        "prompt": "Original Post(OP)'s title: CMV: Elements created in a lab that cannot exist in nature or in quantities greater than a few atoms for microseconds at a time have no place on the periodic table\nOriginal Post(OP)'s text: I'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium) or [ununtrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium), I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table.\n\nThe atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.\n\nCalling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, \"Look! I've created a bookbottle!\"\n\nThe object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.\n\nUnunpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.\n\nChange my view.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. \n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n&gt;Short half life\n\nIt's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.\n\n&gt;Very few atoms at a time\n\nThis is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.\n\n&gt;Not outside the lab.\n\nWhere it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.\n\nThere are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.\nArgument: The very definition of a chemical element is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Those Protons, along with however many Neutrons it takes to hold it together, comprise its Atomic Weight.\n\nNow, it is true that atoms of high atomic weight are unstable and decay. Think of it as a giant lego sculpture--you can build extremely large objects, but those plastic pieces only have so much clutch power and beyond a certain size they will fall apart under their own weight. \n\nJust because that sculpture isn't independently stable doesn't mean that it didn't exist, or that the design for it isn't a perfectly valid configuration of its component parts. You could use a drafting program to *design* a 1:1 scale 747, and the pieces would still fit together just fine, whether or not it could exist in the environment.\n\nPlutonium, to a first approximation, doesn't exist in nature; its half-life is too short relative to the stellar fusion processes (supernovas) which would produce any natural amounts of it. All the plutonium for all the reactors and warheads we've ever made came from bombarding Uranium with neutrons and converting it into a different chemical with different chemical properties. \n\nWhere these elements slot into the periodic table also makes predictions about how these elements behave, what they'd react with, and what form they would take under standard environmental conditions. The regular patterns of nature is what defines the rows and columns of the periodic table, hypothesize what would fit into a given spot, then go out and actually \"build\" that atom to see if it can be done.\n\nPlutonium, though it's entirely manmade, still reacts with other elements in certain ways, with itself in certain ways. It's an element. It belongs on the periodic table. To an alien life form that exists on billion-year time frame, Plutonium would be just as fleeting as Ununonium. Does it not belong on the periodic table just because its lifespan arbitrarily fits within a significant portion of how one species on one planet experiences time?\n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view.\n\nBased on the above information, please give me your answer following these guidelines:\n1. You should provide your explanation before you respond with the prediction.\n2. Your prediction should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n\nThe response is:",
        "response": "Explanation: This argument refutes the OP's main view by addressing the criteria for what they consider to be a legitimate chemical element. The respondent argues that these artificially-created elements should not be discounted just because they only exist under certain conditions and/or for a limited duration, pointing out that their existence is governed by the same physical laws which underlie the more familiar elements on the table. They also compare the situation to Plutonium, which is also largely man-made but nevertheless behaves predictably in chemical reactions and has undisputed status as an element.

If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and \"gotchas.\"  \n\nA crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.\n\nThis is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.\n\nAs far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.   Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

However, a crisis simulation for a politician or presidential candidate would be far more difficult to carry out. It would involve social situations where an action could have a very wide variety of outcomes, based on subtle and complicated factors that a simulation could never truly mimic.\n\n I'd imagine that a candidate simulation would be like playing a text based game, where every decision leads to consequences which arguably would not have happened in a real life situation.

        "prompt": "Original Post(OP)'s title: CMV: Growth of economy is not interesting.\nOriginal Post(OP)'s text: To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in their personal life based on this kind of statistic? For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy: low skill job and doing things yourself means you won't be buying blueberries from other people. Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market.\n\nOne could do that, yes, but I find it laughable how this is the priority goal for politicians - not health, literacy, justice, equality or some other virtue. When asked why economy should grow, they give contrived reasoning from dynamics of economy. They ignore that economy seems to work in cyclic process of growth and decline. Tragicomically many are ready to *worsen* living conditions of masses to accelerate economic growth. What is the point in all this? How can someone strongly support economic growth while having no interest in either means or results of it?\nArgument: &gt; Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange.\n\nThe economy also includes the exchange goods *and services*, not goods alone. So lawyers, doctos, yoga instructors all exchange their services for goods and services from others.\n\n&gt;  For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy\n\nWhat do you mean by this exactly? It may not require too much skill, but it's hard work and does require speed and attention to detail while picking the blueberries.\n\n&gt; Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market.\n\nNo, it does not. Organic food is more expensive than its substitutes. As for the electronics, no one recommends replacing a phone year after year. People choose to eat junk, and buy replaceable products. The money that people save by not spending on electronics goes to other goods and services. Even if it goes in the bank, it's put into the system and made available to investors.\n\nBy the way, politicians make a HUGE deal of education. Every single campaign makes education of the cornerstones of their campaigns because it appeals to so many voters. And the same goes for healthcare. \n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view.\n\nBased on the above information, please give me your answer following these guidelines:\n1.

In other words, if I don't know you at all, my respect for you won't change based on your gender, orientation, race, religion, etc (If I do know you, and you give me reason to increase or decrease my respect for you, I will, of course).\n\nI think that referring to people based on their accomplishment is just fine -- being the First Person in Space is a grand title for Yuri Gagarin. But why is he referred to as the first *man* in space? To me, calling Valentina Tereshkova the First *Woman* in space simply emphasizes her difference -- she's female -- instead of her accomplishment.\n\nIf we're all supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of race, nationality, gender, orientation, religious views, etc; wouldn't referring someone as the first *whatever* to do something simply remind everyone that the difference is still there, and make it that much more difficult to ignore in the future?\n\nEDIT: My V has been C'd! I see that the social impact of the accomplishment is equally important, and we need to recognize what these people had to go through in order to actually get there!

        "prompt": "Original Post(OP)'s title: CMV: Coffee is overrated, the effects received are negligible and often a placebo, and people who say they like the taste are lying to themselves.\nOriginal Post(OP)'s text: I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.\n\nEvery child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.\n\nI consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.\n\nThe extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.\n\nIt seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nCould that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?\nChange my view.\n\n\n\nArgument: [The effects of caffeine on the human body are very well documented](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=effects+of+caffeine&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eThWVe7kO_X8sASBu4CQCg&amp;ved=0CBwQgQMwAA) and to describe it as a placebo is just plain wrong.  While coffee is not the only way to get caffeine, the majority of people who drink coffee are doing so mostly for the caffeine.  If you don't need the caffeine in your daily routine, then this would make sense as a reason that you do not need to drink coffee.  I would also like to point out that different people have different sensitivities to the drug, so you might be tolerant enough to the extent that you don't feel any obvious effects after a single cup.  As caffeine tends to be subtle, this is highly likely (especially if you have already been getting the proper amount of sleep).\n\nAs far as taste goes, it is an acquired taste.  I am a fan of things that taste bitter in general, so coffee is not that big of a jump for me, but most people do not like bitter flavors as much as so coffee may be a bit too strong of a flavor for them.  There is also the fact that the majority of the easy to access coffee doesn't actually taste very good.  The main objective of most coffee is to get caffeine into the body, and so it sacrifices taste to make it easier to brew in large amounts.  the instant coffee that you reference being familiar with is one of the worst offenders in this area.  It is specifically designed to be easy to prep so someone who is not fully awake early in the morning can get their coffee going without much hassle.  That easy of use naturally sacrifices it being optimized for taste.\n\n&gt;It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nStarbucks actually doesn't have very good straight coffee.  Their plain coffee tends to be burnt and generally over cooked.  However, most of their products sell not based on their coffee, but on the sugar and cream that they add to most drinks.  As such, it is a great place to get coffee if you don't like the taste of coffee and want to hide it with other flavors so you can still get the caffeine, but as far as people who like plain coffee, it is not very good.\n\nIf you ever want to try what is generally considered the best coffee in the world, find a good Turkish restaurant and order a Turkish coffee.  It is very bitter, so if you are not a fan of bitter you will not like it, but everyone who likes coffee likes Turkish coffee (as a side note, Turkey is one of the first cultures to regularly drink coffee, so they have some of the oldest traditions and recipes associated with coffee).  If you are a fan of alcohol at all, you can try an Irish coffee.  It is like a normal coffee, but instead of adding milk, Irish cream or whiskey is added (often served with a bit of whipped cream on top).  It is one of my favorite alcoholic mixed drinks.\n\n&gt;Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee?\n\nI think so.  It is a drink with about 500 years of history behind it, and in that time some people have made it exceptionally good.  However, as teh majority of coffee is served not for taste but for the caffeine, it is likely that you haven't had any super high quality coffee before.  The is also the possibility that you are just not a fan of bitter tastes in general, in which case coffee may never appeal to you.\n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view.\n\nBased on the above information, please give me your answer following these guidelines:\n1. You should provide your explanation before you respond with the prediction.\n2. Your prediction should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n\nThe response is:",
        "response": "The argument provides scientific evidence that coffee's abilities aren't merely a placebo effect, establishing the legitimacy of caffeine in providing energy. It then debunks the OP's claim of people lying about liking the taste of coffee by explaining taste as a subjective factor and enumerating various types of coffee that the OP could try. The debater counters the OP's generalizations about 'elite' coffee drinkers and Starbucks, detailing the reasons behind their preferences. The argument also acknowledges that while OP might not have had good coffee yet, it doesn't invalidate the entire coffee culture, which shows respect for OP's personal experience.
