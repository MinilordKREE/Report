Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once.

        "text": "The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there’s usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is often well after substantial ambiguous conversation. For the purpose of this CMV, I will grant that a fetus is a human person. \nMy views:\n\n1.\tAbortion may or may not be morally permissible, though I lean towards permissible. I don’t really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it’s here for some background on my position.\n\n2.\tAbortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother’s legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus’ (or child’s) right to use them.\n\nOne of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I’d prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I’ve heard is as follows:\n\n\nLet’s say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can’t be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9+ months to a fetus to keep it alive.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThere are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first:\n\n/u/garnteller:\n&gt;So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it?\n\nMy realization as I thought through the implications:\n&gt;This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario:\n\n\n&gt;In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters.\n\n\n&gt;Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen.\n\n\n&gt;So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time.\nThis seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body.\nI guess if a fetus really is a person, it probably should be illegal to abort it.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "text": "Whenever I book air travel, I always sit in a window seat, and I contend that the window seat is the far superior seat in almost every way. \n\n1) The views are amazing. The majority of people even 50 years ago had not had the ability to travel by air due to its high cost, and therefore lacked the ability to see the amazing views afforded by sitting at the window of a jet airplane. In my travels, I've been able to look down at the glaciers and coasts of Greenland, see the Grand Canyon from the air, look down on Niagara Falls, appreciate the rolling green hills of New Zealand, and behold the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains. And this is all in less than a decade of regular air travel, and I'm not even counting the fact that just about EVERY view from the air is amazing, even if it's just the cornfields of Nebraska. The longer I keep flying, the more amazing perspective about the beauty and scale of our planet I will be able to appreciate.\n\n2) A place to rest your head to nap. When you have an overnight flight, or a really early flight, and you just need to catch some extra ZZZs on the plane, the window seat is the best place to be because you can ball up your jacket and use it as a pillow against the wall.\n\n3) Elbow and foot protection. The few times I've been unfortunate enough to sit in the aisle seat, I almost always get bumped on my elbow or foot by the drink cart coming down the aisle. It's just such a narrow aisle, and the cart takes up the entire width, that it's bound to hit you at some point, especially if your shoulders are a little wider, or if you're engrossed in a book or headphones and can't hear them asking everyone to move. In the window seat, this is never a problem and you don't risk getting bumped. \n\n4) Control of the window shade. Sometimes it does get really bright outside, and in that case, the person in the window seat has complete control over how high or low to keep the shade. You get to set it at the level that's comfortable for YOU. \n\n5) Not having to get up to let others in during boarding. When I get on the plane, I like to sit down and use those few minutes to answer some emails or text messages, or (admittedly) scroll through Reddit's front page a bit. When sitting in a window seat, once you're seated, you're done. You can sit there uninterrupted for the whole duration of boarding. If you're seated in the aisle or middle, you run the risk of being interrupted and having to stand up, clog the crowded aisle, and losing time to do the things you were doing while waiting for boarding.\n\nNow I'll admit there are a couple problems with the window seat:\n\n1) No easy access to lavatory. You have to ask two other people to get up when you need to use the bathroom. However, I think that with some good advance planning, one can use the bathroom in the terminal and not have to use it at all on a shorter flight. For longer flights, is it really that bad to have to ask someone to get up for a minute to let you out? They know you'll need to go at some point, so as long as it isn't every 20 minutes, I think it's totally fine. And if it really bothers you to inconvenience strangers, you can wait until the middle seat person needs to use the lavatory, and then just go at that point when the aisle person is already getting up. \n\n2) Can't stand up when the plane parks to get your luggage first and/or stretch your legs. But this doesn't seem like such a problem. I mean, you've just been seated for a number of hours on the flight...what's 10 more minutes? Just wait patiently for the aisle to clear, then grab your bag.\n\nIn summary: I believe the window seat is clearly the superior choice when flying. It's not perfect, but on balance, it affords the most interesting scenery, the most comfort, and the most convenience. \n\nThe reason I'd be interested to have my view changed is for those times when I may be stuck in an aisle seat for reasons outside my control, and I'd like to know the reasons why it's not so bad to have to sit on the aisle and not feel like my entire flying experience is ruined by not getting the window seat. \n\nI think we can all agree that sitting in the middle seat is an unsatisfying and degrading experience in every possible way. \n\nEdit: a word\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "title": "CMV: Statistics should be a mandatory part of the high school curriculum, but NOT as a replacement for any standard mathematics courses.",
        "text": "Increasingly, many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum.  I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century.  But to argue, as some have, that this should *replace* the traditional \"algebra to calculus\" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English.  While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education.\n\n\nAlthough the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.  \n\n\nIn a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.  \n\n\nYou can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\n\nAs a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions.  I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.  I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department.  But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals.\n\n\n**To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.\n\n\nThank you again to all who responded.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think [what I said then](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/cthkp5o) applies here: if we have to chose, discrete math is more valuable than statistics.\n\nThis is mostly going to be an argument that discrete math should replace something in the calculus-track curriculum. However, many introductory discrete math courses spend a fair amount of time covering statistics, and I think that's very valuable for many of the same reasons you've covered. I think that discrete math courses typically paint a very coherent story up to statistics -- much more so than jumping straight into statistics. You talk about deductive reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, and probability before getting to statistics. I think learning and understanding all of those things helps frame statistics in a more intuitive way. For example, Bayes' Theorem (which is, in my experience, a topic in most introductory statistics courses) is much better understood with a firm understanding of deductive reasoning, set theory, and probability.\n\nYou say this about calculus-track curricula: \n\n&gt; In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.\n\nI fervently agree that learning to reason deductively is important. Wouldn't you say that a better way to learn deductive reasoning is to teach it directly? \n\n&gt; You can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\nAgain -- totally agree abstract reasoning is important. I just don't think calculus or algebra are the best topics to teach this skill to the average student. Too often they devolve into rote application of formula or theorems that have no meaning to the student. Teaching deductive reasoning directly generally doesn't suffer from this problem, because the theorems that do exist are incredibly intuitive.\n\nIn closing, I'd propose that a better change to high school math curriculum would be:\n\n1. For the general population, teach discrete math instead of (pre-)calculus. Topics should include deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics.\n2. For more advanced students, offer followup courses in both statistics and calculus.  (I guess this is probably already the case at most good schools).",

        "text": " I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say \"entertainment\", but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have some sort of moral dilemma that questions an aspect of our society. A good piece of writing is designed to make the reader feel empathetic towards the characters, so the events that occur due to the choices the characters make with regards to the dilemma, in the end will suggest to the reader what is *right* versus what is *wrong*.   \n \nI was discussing this with my girlfriend the other day, and we used \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" as an example. My point was that this book shows (among other things) that racism and prejudice is morally wrong. She argued that this wasn't the intention of the book; the book just addresses the issue of prejudice in a neutral way, and it is up to the reader's internal moral compass to decide whether racism is right or wrong. While it is certainly possible to read the book and not have your views on racism changed, I argue that it was the author's intention to suggest that it was wrong.     \n  \nHere, I extend my argument to the majority of all literature. Great works of literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, etc, are all intended to persuade readers to one side of a moral issue. Over history, stories and literature are a great way of defining what we as a race have defined as right and wrong.  \n\n**CMV!**\n  \n  \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "BANNED? That's quite extreme, don't you think? For my arguments I will be using a few sources: [#1](http://jonathanrose.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rose-in-Taras-Waddell.pdf), [#2](http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/irpp06%20rose.pdf) &amp; [#3](http://195.130.87.21:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/513/1/Political%20Marketing%20In%20Modern%20Canadian%20Federal%20Elections.pdf).\n\n\n\nAs I understand it your view is based on *negative* attack ads used by political parties, but not all ads used by the political parties are attack ads, or negative. (But please realize that negative is a loose term, even an ad that says something bad about another party's policy is \"negative\" even if it does it in a neutral tone. There's a specific term for that: acceptable negative.) Most ads tell us the priorities of competing parties and the differences in their policy platforms. They serve a very useful function: To provide voters with information in a simple manner that is easily recalled. Points made in debates are not easily recalled since they get lost in the back-and-forth.\n\n\n\nEven negative ads serve a very useful function. They may be ugly, but they're often full of information regarding a political party's position on a policy or a candidate's weaknesses. They are actually scrutinized to a much higher level than positive ads and actually serve an important purpose in getting the public to engage with issues.\n\n\n\nNegative ads are based on policy over personality in a 4:1 ratio, so the media's mania over the overinfluence of negative ads is overblown. In fact, as you can see from the second source I provided Canadians do not react favourably towards personal attack ads and all parties are wary of crossing a line and losing votes as a result. Some negativity is to be expected, but Canadians are pretty nice about it all.\n\nPlus, there's the simple fact than one party (CPC) is the best at fundraising --probably because it's the only major right-of-centre party-- and it uses that money to produce ads b/w elections, when there's no restriction on spending. By banning attack ads, you're penalizing the other parties from being able to defend themselves from attacks b/w elections. Please take a close look at table 7.2 in the first source I've provided - the disparities in spending are shocking.\n\n\nBut what about your alternative of more debates? Is it really a good idea to have a LOT of debates and no ads? I don't think so. I watched the recent Maclean's Leaders Debate and while I enjoyed the debate, I was appalled at the post-debate analysis. The talking heads were discussing which *zinger* really hit home and how it would affect that leader's image. There was another section --the most awful one, in my opinion-- that had a \"[body language expert](https://youtu.be/hSf2__qpeGA?t=2h44m24s)\" analyze the body language of each of the candidates and draw conclusions on their personality **and** policy. It was AWFUL! If the television media actually cared about reporting on policy, I'd be with you for all debates all the time. But they boil it down to a competition among leaders that's part of the problem. The media's focus remains on \"the process of politics rather than its substance.\"\n\nI hope this changes your view.\n\nEdit: clarity and fixed a link.\n\nEdit 2: More edits for clarity and grammar.",

        "text": "Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism -- which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for the \"not all men\" sentiment. \n\nI'd like to start out by establishing a few things, because it's important to know that I don't support using this sentiment broadly.\n\n1. Where a victim is grieving, confiding, venting, or however else they are dealing with a problem, it is an inappropriate time to use \"not all men\". The focus belongs on the victim and their healing at that time, not nitpicking their wording.\n2. \"Not all men\", in the way I'm using it here, is actually \"not all X\", where X is any group in a discussion that has a broad, negative statement said toward their group. We see it most frequently thanks to the (most often deserving) scorn targeted at the \"not all men\" sentiment, but I do mean Not all X, where X is any group.\n\n###The value of accurate language\n\nAs a young boy, when I said \"women are bad at math\", my father corrected me. He said \"some women are bad at math\". When my brother said \"you never let me go to town,\" he corrected him by saying \"I usually don't, but here are the times I did\". My father took issue with \"global\" language, as he called it, no matter what form it came in, because he saw it as harmful.\n\nHave you ever felt a burden to prove you're some blanket statements that was often leveled against your kind? \"Women are bad at math\", or \"women cry so easily\", or \"blacks are stupid\", or \"feminist hate men\". For me personally, when I saw \"men are so shallow\" growing up I felt a sense of hostility from the statement. It felt like a judgement against me, and I felt like I had to carry the burden to show people that even though men are shallow, I'm a man and I'm not.\n\nThe point is, if we use careful speech, like \"I hate it when men are shallow / some men are so shallow\", OR \"It really bothers me a woman cries over the smallest thing\" and \"some women cry so easily\", we avoid creating broad, negative labels.  These labels can create a great sense of shame in the targeted group, and this shame fosters a sense of otherness. Instead of the shamed person feeling included or a part of something, they feel excluded. This, and the shame can also sabotage a person's self value and chance at success.\n\nBy biggest concern is the sense of otherness it can create, driving away potential allies, and by god we need a lot of allies to address the institutionalized racism and sexism in most western nations.\n\n**Therefore**\n\n1. I believe it is in the best interest of those seeking to address an oppressive culture to use accurate language in order to be inclusive to as many as possible, to maximize their efforts\n2. Just as it is the responsibility of the privileged to not use broad, negative language to describe the oppressed, it's also (far down on the priority list) the responsibility of the oppressed to not use broad, negative language to describe the privilege. Because, really, it's a human's responsibility to a human to not use broad, negative language against a human. To a reasonable length, of course,  and I d not believe adding \"some\" before men, women, asians, etc, is much of a stretch.\n\n###Picking an appropriate time\n\nAgain, the time to say \"not all X\" is not when a victim is trying to overcome their harm. But in casual conversation, as a small aside, it is good for all people to correct others when they use this harmful, broad language.\n\n####Conclusion / TL;DR: No matter the group, broad language assigning negative traits to another group is harmful, and it is our responsibility as humans to take reasonable efforts to avoid propagating this harm, starting first with ourselves, second in mild conversation, and never while a victim is trying to overcome harm. We should never become comfortable using broad, negative language.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

But why do people get upset with the censorship of books, and not movies or video games?\nIf you are under the age of 17, you are not allowed to see a rated “R” movie without a parent. But you are allowed to go to a bookstore and buy any book you want, no matter how controversial the subject matter. Why is it okay to censor movies and not books? Like books, movies contain ideas, messages, and provoke thought and conversation. I have seen movies that have changed my way of thinking. Most of those movies are rated “R”. How is it fair to restrict teenagers from experiencing the stories and ideas of this particular medium, while allowing those same stories and ideas through literature?\n\nThe same thing goes for video games. There are video games that have been banned from western countries because of content. Oftentimes, game developers have been forced to edit the content in games (depict less blood or sexuality) in order to legally sell their product in a country. This is censorship, plain and simple. They are banning art and ideas because they are controversial and make people uncomfortable. Could you imagine what would happen if we did this with books? Banned them unless the author edited, rewrote, or removed certain scenes? There would be an uproar.\n\nHere is a list of some video games that have either been censored or banned in certain countries:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games[1]\n\nSome people might argue that we are stricter with movies and video games because you can actually see the violence rather than just reading about it. But I don’t really buy this argument. In high school, I had to read “The Sorrow of War” by Bao Ninh. For those of you who haven’t read it, the book is extremely graphic and violent. There were vivid descriptions of people stabling and shooting each other in the face, tanks running over and crushing bodies, and torture. One of the main characters is raped in graphic detail. Profanities, including words like “Fuck” “Shit” and “Cunt” are everywhere. The fact that a 16 year old is allowed and encouraged to read this book, while at the same time banned from watching 22 Jump Street in theaters alone (a movie that is rated R solely because of the language”), is baffling.\n\nTo be clear, I do not agree with regulation and censorship at all. But since we enforce it on games and movies, I think that books should be held to the same standard. CMV.",
        "argument": "I think there's an important distinction between age limits and outright censorship.  \"Censorship\" in the political sense means that you are suppressing or editing a book, movie, or another work on the basis of the words and ideas contained inside it being deemed \"unacceptable\" by some authority figure.  The problem with censorship is that it abridges the freedom of adults to choose the media they consume and to expose themselves to whatever content they want.  \n\n\nMPAA and RIAA ratings, on the other hand, are age limits that apply only to children under 17.  They aren't removing these movies or video games from the marketplace of ideas, or even preventing children from seeing them.  They are just giving parents the choice about whether to expose their children to those media, rather than allowing children to have that choice themselves.  Rightly or wrongly, children under the age of 17 are under the guardianship of their parents, and our society and our legal system gives parents to make certain choices on behalf of their children until they reach a certain age.  You can argue that age 17 is arbitrary, but I think most people would agree that children below SOME age are not really capable of deciding themselves what media is appropriate to consume.  So then it's just a question of picking where the arbitrary age cutoff is.\n\n\nAge limits on books are actually quite common.  It is illegal for example, to sell erotica to children, and many bookstore chains have also adopted their own content limits in terms of what books they'll sell to young kids.  Parent groups and others will often force schools and libraries to ban certain titles (or to remove them from school curricula) for putative \"graphic content\" or political controversy.  Morally, this doesn't seem to me much different from the MPAA/RIAA rating systems; the only real difference is that it's done on an ad-hoc basis at the consumer level, rather than nationally by an industry-wide board.\n\n\nAlso, I agree with u/forestfly1234 that the layer of interpretation needed to understand graphic content in books provides another layer of protection (generally, in my experience as a teacher, kids who are old enough to understand what they're reading are usually old enough to handle the content, and the same is definitely not true of movies.)",

I am not saying anything against this definition. If the experts want to define things this way, I'm certainly in no position to say otherwise.\n\nHowever, \"Black is a color\" should still be a valid statement. My shirt is 'black.' I'm not a color-physicist, but I'm almost certain that it does not completely absorb the full spectrum of colors. If I wanted to be totally correct, I would have to say: \"My shirt is a color that very nearly approximates black.\" (Disproving this would be a very easy way to CMV!)\n\nThere are enough black-colored items in the world for this to be ridiculous. Thus, it's only logical that when we are casually talking to other humans, and mention the word 'black,' it can be assumed that we're referring to this close-enough faux-black, which does reflect (I'd assume) some light, and thus is totally a color. \n\nThe argument for white follows similarly.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that it's wrong to say that black and white aren't colors.

        "title": "CMV: BuzzFeed is a terrible news organization and hurts the field of journalism",
        "text": "Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate \"News\" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbait/native advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand \"BuzzFeed News\" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright. Still not going to use it for my news (or anything really) but definitely see it in a new light. Thanks for the perspective and interesting discussion guys!\n\nBuzzfeed is a terrible news organization. They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. \"Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!\" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility.\n\nI've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praise/defend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate.\n\n1. **BuzzFeed has a large base** \"BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption\"\n\nThis is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumption/getting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to read/buy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids.\n\n2. **Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed** \"The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!\"\n\nYea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source.\n\n3.**They do really good pieces** \"I'll admit 90% of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of 'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event.\"\n\nThat's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have \"17 Pizza's that look like Ohio\" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky.\n\n4.**They get people to read the news** \"Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before.\"\n\nIt's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to news/journalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think \"This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!\" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill.\n\n5.**It's a new platform, the next evolution** \"You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt.\"\n\nPrint journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a 'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of \"3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter\" still isn't news. \n\nThat's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought \"BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't.\" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on.\n\nAnyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed. So hopefully someone changes my view, but we'll see.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

        "text": "First I think I should make all the clarifications I can.  By \"true Christian,\" I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.  A \"true Christian\" actively analyzes his or her own behavior and actively attempts to better themselves based on Jesus's teachings.  And by \"behavior,\" I specifically refer to relationships with others, social interactions, lifestyle, and actions over words. \n\nBy \"support the United States,\"  I want to refer specifically to U.S. foreign policy and action, specifically the current/recent wars in the middle east.  Also think about matters such as:\n\n-support of the state of Israel (not condeming it's terrible actions) \n\n-CIA/blackops/paramilitary operations around the world\n\n-backing of dictators and tyrants because they do the bidding of corporate interests\n\n-use of torture\n\n-use of drone strikes\n\n\n\n\n\nI was raised as a Christian (ECLA Lutheran) and although I am now an agnostic, the moral teachings of Jesus and Christianity have not left me.  Here is my understanding of Christianity and the teachings of Jesus, and I will also say that every civil, intelligent conversation I have had about religion has ended with these same conclusions:\n\n-Everyone should try their very best to follow the golden rule, the second commandment, or whatever you want to call it:  \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\"  \"treat others how you want to be treated,\" etc.  It's a pretty universal moral code amongst humanity, but is specifically important to Christianity\n\n-People are not perfect.  They commit sins.  But if you try to live your life to the best of your ability following the golden rule, to care for and love others as yourself, and confess your sins to be forgiven by Jesus/God, then you will be saved.  You can get into all the ins and outs of the \"resurrection,\" but when it comes down to it, the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus is to forgive the sins of those who attempt to live good lives and sincerely admit/confess their sins.  If you don't actually mean it and feel remorse, it's meaningless.\n\n-God is love, submit yourself to the will of God, humble yourself before God, you are nothing compared to God, love God with all of your heart, etc.\n\nHere are some relevant Jesus quotes:\n\n\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\"\n\n\"But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.\"\n\n\"For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?\"\n\n\"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.\"\n\n\"I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n\"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n\"Give to everyone who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.\"\n\n\"All the commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and so on, are summed up in this single command: You must love your neighbor as yourself.\"\n\n\"For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?\"\n\nNow the main reason why I disaffiliated myself from Christianity can be best described by a quote of Gandhi: “I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”  That and I realized there is a high probability that Jesus did not actually exist, at least as we fantasize him as having supernatural powers.  But the teachings and moral code of Jesus/Christianity is an entirely separate entity that exists outside of any supernatural belief.  And it is this observation that makes me ask why/how the United States can call itself a Christian nation and do the things it does?  Or you substitute \"Christain nation\" for \"morally superior\" or some other similar term.  I think it's a fairly prominent belief here that \"we are the good guys,\" so whatever we have to do to maintain our power and lifestyle, we are absolutely justified in doing.  But how can you be a true Christian, and actively support that?  That seems to directly contradict the teachings of Jesus in so many ways.  Please prove me wrong.  And please provide specific examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

[Ken White at Popehat describes how:](http://popehat.com/2011/12/01/reminder-oh-wont-you-please-shut-up/)\n\n&gt;Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie — for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You — having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer — obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material — but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government.\n\n&gt;Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works — even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge — a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations.\n\nI think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.

I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.\n\nThe reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that \"love is love\" and \"loving who you choose is your right\". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.\n\nNow I won't delve into the typical response of \"Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!\" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what \"marriage\" is.\n\nI believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of \"love is love\" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of \"marriage\" to include anything we want it to under the law.\n\n~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this \"relationship\"~~.\n\nBut then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.\n\nEdit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future.

        "text": "Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am *not* against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders. \n\nAnyway, some of the terms that come to mind are *Agender* and *Androgynous*. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? *Genderfluid* and *Bigender* seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. \n\nDoes it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as *gender-fluid* because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than *cross-dressing*. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing.\n\nAlso, what's the deal with \"cis\"?\n\n* Cis-female.\n* Cis-male.\n* Cis-man.\n* Cis-woman.\n* Cisgender.\n\nIf the definition of \"cis\" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they *just* be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy).\n\nAgain, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone *actually* identifying as something.\n\nWith that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're \"gender-fluid\" or \"cis-female\". It makes me believe that I may be seeing this the wrong way - or maybe these terms really are inessential and pointless?\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "text": "To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.\n\n1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.\n\n2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook?\n\n3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality\n\nOf course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The guy is then facing rape charges.\" Is this what really happens most often? Or, is it more often the case that the female is drunk, the man is not, and he takes advantage of the situation. Two drunk people having a one-night stand does not result in rape charges nearly as often as one sober and one drunk/unconscious person does. \n\n3. First of all, there are feminist groups such as SWAN (Service Women's Action Network) who push for female-inclusion in Selective Service. Second, the Draft is not a relevant issue today. Neither you nor anyone else is going to be drafted any time soon. Feminist groups--like any politically-active group--typically focus on *relevant* issues that actually affect people. So it's no wonder you don't see a lot of attention placed on it by feminist groups because at this point it doesn't really affect anyone one way or the other. Yes, men have to sign up for it, but it's only a relic of a system that is no longer used. If people were actively drafted and the majority of feminists supported the current system, you might have a point. But since the draft is not something that is likely to happen any time in the near future, you can't really blame feminists for wanting focus on more relevant issues.\n\nIt's difficult to address your problems with feminism because you haven't brought up any specific examples of mainstream feminists.

Assuming the worst case and a student pays full sticker price, that's around 125k in debt. But with almost all private schools, there are plentiful scholarship and grant opportunities. Even for students who support themselves (meaning no financial help from their parents), these options make the 125k number far less. This forgets the fact that according to the same source, students can attend an in-state university for just shy of 10,000, for a far more affordable (and worst case) of 40k.

        "text": "I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).\n\n[Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)\n\nOne could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.\n\nThe people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.\n\nIf a \"buffer\" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.\n\nAlbeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution.

The Palestinian diaspora has no such source of funding, hence it is doubtful that they would be able to actually water in a climate that is even more harsh than Israel's is, on average.\n\n3) Israel is generally thought of as being one of the most over-populated areas in the world, relative to it's carrying capacity. It is possible that global warming will exacerbate the issue along with the changing climate, and this would also likely apply to the Palestinian Sinai.\n\n4) Egypt won't sign on to it because it weakens their hold over the Suez Canal by putting a foreign nation on the other bank pretty close to the canal.\n\n5) Palestine won't sign on to it because, let's face it, they just won't. You're implicitly saying that the Palestinians should be forced to move out of their present lands for no reason other than their own ethnicity.\n\n6) Israel won't sign on to it because lately the Israeli government has been against the establishment of any Arab Palestinian government in the region.",

Yes, but they will be our children.” - Marvin Minsky*\n\nSo firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future (maybe even only a few millennia), it will be by integrating ourselves with technology and shedding our fragile organic bodies.\n\nWhat is the maximum typical lifespan of a sentient organic species? Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant. Will the Earth still be inhabitable for us in our current states by the time another instant passes? Luckily, we’ve already started primitively engineering and augmenting ourselves, with genetic modification, prosthetic legs, hearts, ears, etc. The technological advances in just the last 100 years (as well as the damage we’ve done to our planet) has been incredible— what will the next 5,000 bring?\n\nLet’s assume for the sake of argument that the nearest sentient species developed on a planet 100 lightyears away. (Just FYI, a quick Google/Wolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200km/s, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let’s say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time— only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel.\n\nEssentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological ‘life’. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it’s much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it’s still fully organic.

        "argument": "I think robotics (AI and prosthetics) are just a middle step for us and won't last, therefore we are more likely to meet advanced organic life. As someone else said, a more advanced robot will become more and more like an organic life form as it increases in complexity and redundancy; it would be easier to just start with organic life. Currently it is easier to build a prosthetic arm but in the future, when medical science advances, we would rather grow our arm back and grow it stronger. \n\n Considering long space journeys, a very advanced organic life would be at an advantage over a robotic life form. Organisms have the unique ability to self repair on the micro scale, something I don't think robots will be able to achieve with the same efficiency. Robots could develop some kind of nanites but they would be separate parts needed to repair damage while in organic life every single part of the body is used to make repairs. An advanced robot would need a power source and replacement parts to survive while organisms need only food/water. On a long journey, a robot colony could run out of parts. They could do some limited recycling but only organic life can achieve a perfect recycling system. A perfect system in which waste is consumed again after some re-energizing process fueled by the ship. Advanced Organic life is more likely to survive a space journey\n\nEdit: I should have clarified that I know food is energy but it is easy to grow and doubles as the physical material of our bodies as well while robots would need separate things. I'm assuming that a ship capable of interstellar travel would have a lot of power to supply to its inhabitants so maybe to robots just need a way of storing power within themselves between charges.

While slavery is apparently not illegal on Tatooine, it is nevertheless immoral, and Qui-Gon seems to recognize this. \n\nI realize that gambling on the podrace was necessary, since it would be wrong to take Watto's (non-living) property by force, even if he was dead.

Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free.

Jedi are specifically not supposed to have families, to avoid clouding their judgement (Read: making them hard to indoctrinate). Qui-Gon is ultimately trying to make the Jedi order accept Anakin. Taking his mother with them would work against that goal, furthering Anakin's familial attachments. He tries, and ultimately fails, (though how much of that failure is his, and how much is Obi-Wan's, is up for debate) to separate him from his mother to make him a better Jedi by removing as much of his emotional attachments in order to make him into a more acceptable, emotionally neutral Jedi. Obviously, this ended up failing horrifically, but Qui-Gon had no way of knowing at the time. And admittedly, remember that it ends up being Obi-Wan, not Qui-Gon, that trains Anakin. We have know way of knowing how Qui-Gon had planned on training Anakin to remove his emotional attachments, because he dies and Obi-Wan has to take over to the best of his ability.\n\nRemoving Anakin from his mother is more closely in tune with his overall motives.

Just as Brooklyn kids didn't have full bands for their parties so they used DJs, punks couldn't play well so they turned up the distortion and did the best they could.\n\nBut in time, punk evolved. It kept the short, fast and simple style, but there actually are talented singer/songerwriters in punk, as well as great (if not virtuoso) instrumentation.\n\nCompare the DJing of early hip-hop to modern radio hits. It sounds completely different. But that is only because we've listened enough to understand the subtlety. An old fuddy-duddy might say that both Aesop Rock and Mobb Deep are both guys talking over drums and pops.\n\nWould you think it's crazy for me to say that a Black Flag record sounds very different to me than the Misfits.

People running around, kicking balls. But the more you get into football, the more you are able to enjoy it.\n\nI'd like to give you some homework. Listen to \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" by the Ramones. It is like the \"Rapper's Delight\" of Punk. Then listen to \"Last Caress\" by the Misfits.

I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. \n\nI find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we care/talk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important?  Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X  rather than help either argument.\n\nEdit* This is about society's problems and public conversations rather than individual problems.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "text": "Hello CMV!\n\nFirst of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.\nI believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.\n\nI understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

        "title": "CMV: Prescriptivism",
        "text": "I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as \"correct\" language, that what prescriptivists call \"mistakes\" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.\n\nLinguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single \"correct\" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly \"incorrect\" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.\n\nBut. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any \"correct\" language. For example:\n\n\"He _went_ to the shops\"\n\"He _gone_ to the shops\"\n\nI can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of \"go\" is \"gone\" instead of \"went\". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:\n\n\"Shops went the he to\"\n\nThis isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than \"incorrect\"? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.\n\nSo what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as \"wrong\". Please VCM.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

There is a sense of entitlement among American citizens today; I can't say if it's existed in other epochs, but it does seem to have a deleterious effect on our political discourse, and on civil society more generally.\n\nThat said, the notion that\n\n&gt; Rights are a myth\n\nand\n\n&gt; 'Rights' are not a real thing. They exist only as much as the state allows\n\nis a dangerous one. The notion of limited government, i.e. a government created of, by, and for the people, which can only create new laws within the framework of a constitution, exists to protect citizens from the excesses of unchecked government power. The companion notion of natural rights is necessary for the conception of limited government. If, as you claim, rights come *from the government*, what stops government from switching things up and determining that, for example, we don't have a right to due process? (Some would argue that this is already happening, but I'll get to that in a moment.) That we don't have a right to the proceeds of our labor? What if the President decided that he needed a new palace, that term limits--hell, even those pesky elections--aren't really necessary, and so he upped the tax rate to near 100% and declared himself emperor? Historically, all a ruler needs is the support of the elites and the military to make that happen. A generally-accepted belief in limited government and natural rights doesn't inherently prevent these abuses, but it's a very good first step. (It's especially a good step because the members of the military, who generally aren't the elites, will have been conditioned to believe in limited government just as they have been conditioned to follow strict lines of authority, so they're less likely to quietly sign on to a power grab by a rogue President.)\n\nAs to your point below that \n\n&gt; 'rights' aren't about compromise; they're about entitlement\n\nthis is patently false. Rights will necessarily conflict. There are very few moral systems that argue that there are not overlaps in rights, where priority must be given to some over others. (Modern American libertarians would make the argument that the Non-Aggression Principle is a single rule to determine all disputes, but this is problematic in its own right; for example, it allows for the extreme interpretation that my current self cannot 'enslave' my future self by signing contracts, making the entire institution of binding agreements null and void. I think that any moral system with this level of \"clarity\" necessarily tends toward allowing absurdity like this, if not actively encouraging it.) This is the reason we require a (preferably impartial) judiciary: to determine the precedence and priority of various rights. For example, in the most famous example, my 1st Amendment right to yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater has been deemed, rightfully, to be trumped by society's collective right not to have its citizens deliberately cause physical harm to others. (You could very easily frame that collective right as my responsibility not to cause physical harm to others, and I would agree with it.)\n\nBut wait, you say, that's **government** determining rights! You're [I am] wrong! Rights *do* come from government!\n\nWell, not quite. As a civil society, we need some arbiter that we can all appeal to when our rights come into conflict. Since government has existed seemingly since time immemorial, we have attempted to harness its power to that end. And that's all government is, a way of aggregating power. We like to think that it represents and protects all of us, but government is very easily captured by people who have disproportionate power or wealth to begin with, making it a dangerous tool. Yes, we need government (or some other collectively agreeable arbiter) to decide questions of *whose rights or responsibilities win out in a conflict*, but that doesn't mean the rights in question came from government in the first place. Just because a corrupt government chooses not to protect a set of rights, or actively chooses to violate them (as many police forces seem to be ignoring our 4th Amendment rights, especially in seeking out citizens with drugs), **does not** mean that we didn't have that right to begin with. It is a precondition for challenging the government to the extent necessary to restore the rights. If, as you say, rights *come from government*, then we should ignore public outrage about the TSA, about the War on Drugs, about Ferguson and Baltimore and the myriad places where cops kill people of color, because those are all instances of government agents acting against private citizens. And if those agents, acting according to the rules of their agencies (which can't be doubted, since officers in these situations are extremely rarely prosecuted or punished), have denied citizens their rights, including their right to life, then that right must not have existed in the first place, right?",

While it is true that I've seen a fair amount of foreign (subtitled) movies that got distributed to theaters here in America, it isn't anywhere near parity with the number of American movies that get widespread global distribution.  \n\nBecause so many other people have already learned English as a second language, there's more value in additional people learning English as their second language.  In terms of communicating with people you're likely to be in a position to want to communicate with, English has a lot in its favor.\n\nThere is certainly a case to be made that there are better choices if everyone agreed to ignore those factors.  See Esperanto.

        "text": "I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. If I hadn't been able to get a 100k loan, I wouldn't be 100k in debt right now. I would've gone to a state school, and eventually appreciated that fact once I became more emotionally mature. Parents have a hard time letting their kid get a tattoo, but they let you get a HUGE loan on what is right now a big gamble? Please.\n\nNow, why is that relevant? Well, the economy IS doing well right now, but who exactly is in charge? A bunch of people who the future economy won't affect in the slightest. Since a large majority of millenials are bogged by debt, we can't afford to properly flourish the economy like we want to. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting to be more poor. Someone's going to get fucked.\n\nTechnology is rapidly advancing, and many of the low-income jobs new grads have been forced to take are about to become obsolete. As there is no general income implemented yet, a LOT of people are about to be broke. The only really essential jobs will be things automation can't accomplish, e.g. unpredictable jobs. Almost any job in existence will likely eventually be run by a machine, I can't think of one that can't, there are factories in Japan that do maintenance on themselves.\n\nAs an American, I don't know much about other nations, as school taught me exactly jack shit about them, but I have to wonder if they're in a similar boat. The model on which our economy is built rapidly becomes more out of date every minute. Eventually we WILL have to make changes, and I doubt those in power at the time will have the competence or open mindedness to do so.\n\nOf course, none of this mindset was helped by [this book](http://www.epi.org/publication/failure-by-design/).\n\nPlease, PLEASE someone change my view.

That's a nice change around here.\n\nWhile these are problems, the economy is not destined to fail.  It's a living organism like anything else, and it will adapt to the changing time.  It's a self-correcting problem in many cases.  If there are only 3 rich people left, they can't get richer anymore because there isn't anyone left to give them money for anything.  It becomes in their best interest to keep money flowing through the economy.\n\nRegarding student loans, you've hit the nail on the head.  It's far too easy to get a loan these days, but what is the alternative?  If banks stop giving out loans for colleges, the new rally cry will be \"Banks are discriminating against poor people and making it so only rich people can go to college and better themselves.  The rich get richer!\"  And they'd be right.  \n\nThe root of this problem isn't that it's so easy to get a loan.  It's that everyone believes they need to go to college now.  People take out $100,000 in debt, without any idea what they're even going to spend it on, and then only later does it occur to them that they have to pay that back somehow.  And since we've got this mentality now that college is basically High School: Part 2, colleges can basically charge whatever they want, because we're all under the impression that if you don't go to college, you're basically fucked.",

        "text": "I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it).\n\nMost people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.\n\nEven bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being \"annoying\" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.\n\nAnother reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.\n\nAnother reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a \"tough on crime\" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.\n\nWe punish people because we perceive them as \"deserving it\" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.\n\nI actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider \"bad\" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "text": "With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling \"invaded\" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. \n\nSo here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and \"dark side\" of reddit.\n\n\nEdit: reply from /r/nannyhap produced new idea that perhaps having a place that tolerates hateful views makes for an artificial influx of them. Doesn't quite change my view all the way but definitely something I hadn't considered. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Homophobia, transphobia, fat-shaming, racism, sexism, blah-dee-blah, are all abusive behaviors.\n\nLike, I see what you're saying, I really do, but the existence of the current troll culture (or \"dark side: of Reddit) stems out of the fact that Reddit and similar outlets have traditionally been echo chambers for harmful opinions. They didn't start out as being \"white male\" opinions, but many young white men have adopted them because they've found a community that encourages that sort of behavior, and things just get worse from there.\n\nWhen it comes to spaces, here's the cold, hard facts: if there are spaces where it is actually unsafe to be white and male (and straight), they are few and far between. White males are typically attacked not for whiteness or maleness (or straightness), but for harmful opinions about other communities, which are not fundamental to their straightness/whiteness/maleness.\n\nSo the number of spaces for straight white males has not decreased significantly. The number of spaces for people of any sex/race/gender/orientation to act like total dillholes and abuse other groups of people has decreased, and if you're associating those opinions with whiteness and maleness, I have to fundamentally disagree.",

In order to bring out its full potential you have to add to the pizza, if you do not add to you will not get a good result.

        "text": "I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (\"It's the oldest profession\"; \"we should have full rights to our bodies\") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**\n\nOne of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that \"Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options\".\n\nI fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?\n\nIf I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because \"Desperate people might feel obligated to work them\", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.\n\nI think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:\n\n&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.\n\n&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.\n\n&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.\n\n&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (\"Massage parlors\"). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.\n\n(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).\n\n**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**\n\n-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.\n\n-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.\n\n-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.\n\n**What I would not like to see:**\n\n-Outright moral arguments (\"Selling your body is wrong\", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)\n\n-Any arguments I listed above without additions (\"Women will be forced into sex slavery\")\n\n-Religious arguments\n\nThanks for your time :3\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In most western countries, prositition is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketably skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.  Waiting tables, cashiering, working retail, coupled with a relatively strong social safety net (like foodstamps, medicaid, rental credit/section 8 housing), is how the vast majority of the working poor survive.\n\nIt isn't just psychological and physical damage, there's some serious damage to both the immediate incentives and long term prosperity of people, particularly women, that go into prostitution, which are quite destructive.  Lets ignore the psychological damage/addiction cycles synonimous with prostitution and focus instead simple career growth, total earning potential, and the cycle of poverty.  A prostitute's peak earning potential is when they are the youngest and freshest (probably), and gradually dimishes from there.  Lets say a 20 year old can make 200-300 a night, 5 nights a week, that works out to about 50k-70k per year.  Very good income for someone of that age, certainly tough to walk away from considering the expected income of 20-30k, but nothing you can retire off of, and that's their peak income, and it will only go down from there. After 10 years, they're 30, maybe they're still pretty hot, but they can only get 150 a night.  so that means that after 10 years experience, the 45K.  5 years later, they're probably starting to show their age, lets say it drops down to 150.  39k.  Once they hit 40 they're most likely on their way down, if they stay in tip top shape, they could probably still get 100 a night. (even that's kind of generous).  \n\nAt what point does the person decide that the money isn't worth it anymore?  Is that point before or after when they feel like they're young enough where they can start their career in something else?  Does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age?  \n\nWhile it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises.  There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.\n\nOn the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession.   While the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase.\n\nThe types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.",

        "title": "CMV: We Should execute the weak to improve the human genepool and reduce overpopulation",
        "text": "\n\nAlright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.\nWhat the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.\nHow we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.\nNow another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.\nI would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.\nThis is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.",
        "argument": "You are complaining about humans not letting evolution take place (I'll come to that too), but at the same time you want to counteract what humans evolved to become - supportive of the weak.\n\nThe fact that humans help each other out and save the weak (first in tribes, now in nation states) allowed humans to take over the world. You help me now that I'm weak, I help you another time when you're weak. We both survive, instead of neither of us surviving. Remember, it's survival of the fittest, and fittest doesn't necessarily mean strongest.\n\nNow, I don't see how we're not letting evolution take place. Evolution doesn't mean that in every generation only the strongest are allowed to survive. Evolution means that the genes which are most likely to survive through multiple generations in bodies that are likely to reproduce are likely to be spread the most. So if being determined enough to acquire sufficient wealth to be able to reproduce even if you are fat means that you are more likely to reproduce, then that means that that's a gene that's likely to spread, and that's evolution.\n\nAnd if you really want to solve overpopulation problems, there's far less radical ways to solve that (development help for third world countries etc.). Or just kill everyone who is too old to reproduce.",

Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me. \n",
        "argument": "I'm just starting out hunting, and I've taken some small game, but I don't do it just to see something die, and I hope I never do. I do it because I like the food, I like being outdoors, I like knowing my meat was harvested as painlessly as possible, and in the U.S. it helps prevent habitat destruction by both funding conservation and managing populations that have had their natural predators removed by human intrusion and poor hunting practices prior to the current system. I want future generations to see whitetail deer, water fowl, and wild turkeys, and  can help preserve them by hunting responsibly, while getting some free range organic food out of it. \nEdit: I want to add that when I pull the trigger, I feel a mix of emotions. Seeing something die by your own hands is unpleasant, and I don't get a single bit of pleasure for the act of killing. At the same time, the feeling of accomplishment after spending hours scouting and tracking is a huge rush. I know a lot of hunters say a prayer over their kill, and while I am not religious, I do pause to reflect and respect an animal's passing",

        "text": "In much the same way as drugs, prostitution, gambling, or other \"victimless\" crimes, dog fighting is going to happen irrespective of the law.  Legalization would lead to increased tax revenue, less organized crime. and safer, more humane environments for all those involved.  It would also end the practice of baiting game dogs with helpless puppies and the like.\n\nI understand that many would argue that the dogs are victims (as are drug addicts and prostitutes for that matter), but only in the sense that eating horse meat (which is illegal in many places) victimizes horses, or even horse racing, which is already legalized, taxed, and regulated in controlled environments.\n\nThe fact is countless dogs are already being put to death in animal shelters, often at the taxpayers' expense.  Revenue from dog fighting could alleviate this cost considerably, perhaps even allowing animals to be kept longer, increasing their chances of adoption.  Highly aggressive dogs are unlikely to ever be adopted however (except perhaps by illegal dog-fighting fans currently), nor should they be.  \n\nIt would only be the aggressive dogs used in fights, as they're clearly willing. That's why they need to be kept in separate cages, otherwise they'd be mauling each other of their own volition.  Dogs too old, young, sickly, or cowardly to fight could still be put down as usual since they would make for unentertaining match-ups and would be bad for gambling.\n\nEven the dogs that do fight would receive better medical treatment afterwards from veterinarians on hand, and/or humane euthanasia rather than drowning, hanging, etc.  You certainly wouldn't get the likes of a Michael Vick doing a Pete Townshend impression with a terrier in place of a guitar.  \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "text": "It appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.\n\nHowever, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY).\n\nThe point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong.",

Where I live, the cheapest chinese models cost about 8-10 grand, korean, american and japanese subcompact city cars go for about 10-14 grand, and more compact cars go for 14-18k.  Now, if a new car costs you 14k, like a small toyota, after 5 years and 50,000 m, that car costs about 10-12k, or about 60-75% of it's value.  Toyotas in particular don't depreciate much because of their good reputation, but that's still a lot of money for something that isn't \"new\" anymore, and may have underlying problems and will face maintenance sooner.  This trend is the same across the board with a few exceptions: chinese cars, since the rate of lemons is kind of high, tend to have a much lower resale value.  You basically buy a chinese car for keeps.\n\nit also depends on the situation,  my wife and I are specifically looking for a new car, since her car is 5 years old, we figure it'd be a good idea to alternate buying a new car every 5 years, and buying a seminew car always raises questions.  Why was that car bought in 2014 sold in 2015, when the ink was still dry on the auto loan?  Is it really worth risking 10k to save 2-4k on a car?

The rest of us have just become too polite of a society and other people who are affected by the bad behavior or might be injured in cases where the kid is throwing things, biting and kicking other people should be justified in disciplining a misbehaving child in a way that doesn't cause welts.

I highly doubt there would be many situations when the parent would feel happy you're treating their child bad. But you can let them be mad, you're..In theory..Doing the right thing, if you can take a bit of verbal abuse back at yourself and brush it off then go for it.

You should watch the movie whiplash, it has that kind of abusive relationship to force someone to do what they should be doing. I think you might like that, plus it's a good movie.\n\n If you watch that movie you might be able to see how the child would be feeling in that situation, doing something wrong and being scolded over and over until you finally get it right is a very hard process and most likely won't work unless the person wants to change or is forced to.  Most children will grow out of it and understand what they are doing is wrong once they're forced into a school where behaving normal would be enforced properly, until then it'll mostly be up to the parents.  Your efforts at trying to change them could work amazingly, but most probably be a waste of time.

        "argument": "You're right in a few ways, but ultimately - wrong.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, let's just assume we're talking about the US and Russia. First, there are millions of innocent people that would be killed in a retaliatory strike. There are, however, millions of innocents being killed in the initial Russian strike, and don't they deserve justice? Second, both the US and Russia have defenses designed to intercept and destroy incoming missiles. It's totally theoretical when it comes to the question of how many nukes would make it through anyway, but there's always the possibility that we could stop some, and a portion of the US population would be protected. Wouldn't you want to be fighting back (launching retaliatory strikes) in order to keep them alive?\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is your 3rd point. This reason is *exactly* why we would launch a retaliatory strike. The Russians know that even if they wipe out the entire US population, they won't have a world to enjoy, because between their strike and our retaliation, the world would be ruined. Even if the US didn't retaliate, Earth would be pretty messed up. That much radiation would cripple the environment worldwide, as the radiation slowly spreads to the rest of the world. Because both Russia and the US know that any attack will result in no winner, there's no reason for either to attack. This is called MAD (which I'm sure you know, but for the sake of those who don't - Mutually Assured Destruction). If for one second Russia believed that we wouldn't retaliate, then they wouldn't hesitate to kill us. The reason we're all still alive is *because* we're willing to kill everyone in Russia.\n\nFourth, keep in mind that if Russia wanted to stop us from retaliating, they'd have to hit us *everywhere*, not just the continental US. They'd have to hit every base we have in Europe and across the world, because if they didn't, we'd just send planes carrying nukes from those bases to wipe them out.\n\nEdit: Fifth, if we didn't react, we'd certainly be the \"bigger man,\" but we'd also be dead. Morals are great, but useless when you're dead. You may die with honor, but you're still dead. And when you're dead, who cares how moral you are?

        "title": "CMV: USA was unjustified in bombing Japan to hasten the end of World War 2. The government of USA should apologize from the nation of Japan.",
        "text": "Why I hold this view:\n\n1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\n2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? \nNo one would say yes.\n\n     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. \n\n\n3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\n4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: \n\n“Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”\n\n\nWe erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.\n",
        "argument": "I think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available.\n\nEvery time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. About how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since Japan was going to surrender anyways.\n\nNone of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about Japan's situation at the time.\n\nThe whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that Japan was seeking to surrender forgets that Japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. On July 26th, the Allies in Europe already issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the Allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of Germany's rise after WWI which caused WWII. Two of the points here:\n\n&gt;Point 10: We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.\n&gt;\n&gt;Point 13: We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.\n\nNot only did the Japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but Japan thought it could broker a peace with the US through the Soviet Union which was already preparing its invasion of Japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on Japan within 100 days of its victory over Germany.\n\nIn addition, the power struggle in Japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the Americans held little weight. The Japanese military government was the de facto power in Japan and often overruled the civilian government.\n\nFurthermore, the civilian government simply wasn't trusted by the US or any Allied nations. The Americans remembered that on the afternoon of December 7, Japanese diplomat Kurusu delivered Japan's reply closing with the statement that \"The immutable policy of Japan is to promote world peace.\" He didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of Pearl Harbor had already commenced. What diplomatic integrity did Japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point?\n\nAerial and naval reconnaissance of the Japanese home islands showed that the Japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. These diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the Japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the Allies wanted. In fact, the Allies knew that Japan had tried that strategy before – the whole point of the attack on Pearl Harbor was to buy time for the Japanese to implement their defenses in the Pacific in the hopes that it would make an American counter-offensive unpalatable. \n\nSpeaking of an invasion, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. The pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late October, and Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu was set for X-Day, November 1st. \n\nThe estimates for the death toll of an invasion of Japan were tremendous. This isn't some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the US got closer to the Japanese home islands. On Iwo Jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 Japanese defenders surrendered. The US suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island.\n\nOkinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 Americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. The Japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. That’s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of Okinawa. Now extrapolate that Kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the Battle of Berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed.\n\nThe alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade Japan and starve its people to death. This would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more Japanese than the bombings would have, as history’s famines have shown time and again. Famine isn’t just discriminate – it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. Likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further.\n\nThus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple Japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. The US had already done firebombing, such as the raid over Tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign.\n\nThe atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. Keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings AND from the decades of the Cold War. The very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn’t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used.\n\nAnd for all the people that say the US wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the US dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in Japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. They even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war.\n\nThe Japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning:\n\n&gt; “Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. \n&gt;\n&gt;But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. \n&gt;\n&gt;You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”\n\nChilling to read those words, even today.\n\nThe bombing of Hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the Japanese. As thus, the US proceeded again with the bombing of Nagasaki. Why a second one? \n\nSimply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get Japan to surrender - the US would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. Keep in mind that during this time, the US could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the Cold War. The centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. Nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available – the next one wouldn’t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the US having only 7 total available by the time of X-Day.\n\nThus it wasn't about dropping a second bomb to be punitive – it was dropped because a second one was available. In other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until Japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until Japanese capitulation.\n\nAnd still, even with the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. An attempted coup against the Japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the Emperor made his famous broadcast to the Japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. In it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which I conclude:\n\n&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\n",

This includes language such as \"Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times.\" or \"Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.\"\n\nPeople rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument \"We should teach people NOT TO RAPE\"\n\nMy issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.\n\nThe only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.\n\nMaybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here.

        "text": "After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way.\n\nLet's start off with premise #1\n\n Everything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. \n\nIf premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined. \n\nIf everything is determined than there is no such thing as free will.\nIf every behaviour is determined by laws of causation it is physically impossible for someone to be free, as that freedom would require the nullification of the laws of causation. In other words to believe in free will is also to believe in spontaneous magic, it's to believe that humans possess powers that could only be explained by the supernatural.\n\nFor example: In most legal traditions it is customary to judge whether someone is guilty of x crime by accumulating evidence in order to prove that  x person intentionally did this crime. Let's assume that there was enough evidence to prove without doubt that Greg Smith robbed a convenience store. Now that we have proof that it was Greg, we should ask ourselves if Greg really chose to rob the store. As soon as you ask yourself that kind of question the only scientific recourse you have is to understand Greg as a causal agent. What caused Greg to rob the store? Was it the fact that Greg is from a low socio-economic class? Was it the fact that Greg lost his job 2 weeks ago and Greg wont be able to feed his kids if he doesn't find a way to get more money? Is it the fact that Greg was abused as child? Did Greg rob the store due to complex laws of causality that are reducible to both biological and environmental reasons? Or did Greg simply rob the store because he felt like it?\n\nEven more simple decisions like choosing between a chocolate bar and an apple can be reducible to complex causal interplay between biological and environmental laws. Did you choose the chocolate bar because you like it better? Or is it because we have an evolutionary pull towards sugar and fat dense food? Is it because you read an article on naturalnews.com talking about how dark chocolate can cure your pancreas cancer? Or did you chose the apple because you grew up on an orchard farm and apples remind you of your innocent childhood? or did you choose the apple because you already had psychologically determined bias for foods that will fit in your limited calorie budget for the week?\n\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that as soon as you try to define freedom of choice scientifically it inevitably reduce down to causal mechanisms. Whether those casual mechanisms are internal/biological or external/environmental or a mix of both they are the only things that influence us and completely shape our behaviour. Anything else that can be said to have a role in our behaviours (like our \"independent volition\", our \"moral compass\" and all other notions pertaining to freedom of will) is inherently unscientific and can only be explained through a belief in the supernatural.

        "text": "To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.\n\nThe reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that \"love is love\" and \"loving who you choose is your right\". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.\n\nNow I won't delve into the typical response of \"Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!\" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what \"marriage\" is.\n\nI believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of \"love is love\" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of \"marriage\" to include anything we want it to under the law.\n\n~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this \"relationship\"~~.\n\nBut then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.\n\nEdit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.\n\nThere are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. \n\nI reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.\n\n If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further.

I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.* \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "title": "CMV: Common Core (esp. Mathematics) is a system that is fundamentally flawed and does not prepare students for the real world.",
        "text": "To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out.\n\nLet's take the [Common Core Algebra standards](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction/) as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics.\n\nI believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1981_AHSME_Problems#Problem_30) Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking.\n\nLet's take [Geometry for another example.](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/introduction/) If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason.\n\nIt’s also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh/3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this.\n\nSo far, I’ve touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that’s the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn’t be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn’t the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn’t be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great.\n\nI’ll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it’s effective. Please CMV.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I think reasoning is much more important than having formulas memorized for the real world.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That being said, it seems like your focus is that there is too much memorization and route calculation in CC, and from what I have seen that is far from the case.\n\nYou mention calculators and memorization, many AP science classes have recently undergone revision using the same guiding philosophies as CC and NGSS, and they have changed to allow the calculator and equations sheets for the whole test rather than only part. \n\nIn addition, it might be helpful to see what it is that students are expected to actually do.

I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'll rarely respect an argument against gay marriage, because that is discriminatively denying what should be a basic human right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \n\nAbortion is a very complicated topic, though, and I can understand why someone would be against. Disliking the idea of ending a life before it makes sense is totally fair. I disagree with your position, but I get why you have it.\n\nAnd your opinion is not an asshole opinion. Unlike prohibiting gay marriage, banning abortion isn't trampling over liberties or discriminating. You could make the argument that it's telling a woman she isn't allowed to have control over her own body, but I'd argue that it doesn't reach the same extent. Now, this is certainly to a degree apples and oranges, and not the perfect comparison, but do you understand what I mean? Furthermore, you admit to yourself that you aren't in a position where abortion would matter to you. You know that you have a lack of perspective shaping your opinion. \n\nAnd just because you agree with Redditors on some things doesn't mean you have to agree with them on everything. They're *your* beliefs, and nobody can tell you that if you believe A, you have to also believe B and C.

There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.\n\nNow I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine.

        "argument": "I totally with /u/RustyRook as he says vaccines are one of the single greatest medical interventions that human beings have ever developed.

        "title": "CMV: The United States lost World War II",
        "text": "I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

And, let's look at this argument further-- do you *really* think this could happen? Think about the land behind it. There is not enough land to sell to even allow for, say, a 30% increase in population. Even  if 50% of the population suddenly became another culture (culture vs ethnicity is another argument, but I won't get into that) that wouldn't destroy German-ness; it would just change it, like a melting pot. America has operated under this principle, ethnic mixing led to a culture that is different than other nations. I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all. In fact, if people from another country are coming in, bringing in new traditions, sharing those with me, and not coercing me to do anything-- haven't we both benefited? Aren't we more diverse, and more open to any ideas? It saddens me to see xenophobia amongst white cultures, people who believe their culture is being \"overrun\" by another culture. \n\n&gt;And essentially, the people from that country would have conquered that land\n\nIt isn't conquering. Conquering is taking by force. Let's say I'm a property developer in Portland. Say my corporation owns 500 homes, and we sell them to people coming from India. Has India \"conquered\" the land? Of course not! Such a claim is absurd; because, for one, the people of India are distinct from the government of India (if the Indian *government* bought land and claimed it as New India, where Indian laws apply, that would be different). For two, *it was entirely voluntary*. Nobody forced my hypothetical corporation to sell these homes to Indian people. And for three, that's just a backwards view-- these hypothetical people are very hardworking, and kind. They've done no wrong to anyone.\n\n&gt; That's a very libertarian view on land/a nation's right to their land. \n\nI don't think it's a distinctly libertarian view. It's the concept of private property, the idea that property is owned by individuals, not collectives. I don't think that's radical at all-- that's the very views that figures like John Locke believed in.\n\n&gt;I don't know if I can adequately argue against that\n\nIf you can't argue against a point that disproves your view, and, upon researching, can't find a refutation to that point, you have no reason to believe your original view.

Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children.

While a lot of the arguments for it (\"It's the oldest profession\"; \"we should have full rights to our bodies\") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**\n\nOne of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that \"Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options\".\n\nI fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?\n\nIf I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because \"Desperate people might feel obligated to work them\", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.\n\nI think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:\n\n&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.\n\n&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.\n\n&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.\n\n&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (\"Massage parlors\"). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.\n\n(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).\n\n**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**\n\n-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.\n\n-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.\n\n-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.\n\n**What I would not like to see:**\n\n-Outright moral arguments (\"Selling your body is wrong\", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)\n\n-Any arguments I listed above without additions (\"Women will be forced into sex slavery\")\n\n-Religious arguments\n\nThanks for your time :3\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The problem with no other options available is that prostitution is not as easy as other jobs. Certainly it may be easy to please most Johns, that's not the issue, the issue is that it's not an easy call. Can you imagine yourself working for the sex industry and being required to do a certain amount of dirty things with whoever shows up, as your only option for survival? \n\nYes, it is better than being homeless but it's troubling that people need to provide sex services to survive. It's not easy. I actually have a friend who worked in escorting - The payment is great so it was overall a good experience, but she described as being harsh specially on the psychological side because it's not easy to have sex with strangers and do most things they require\n\n&gt;If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because \"Desperate people might feel obligated to work them\", would that make sense?

Being a man myself, I don't like having sex with strangers and I prefer to be committed first - It's a preference (before you ask, no I'm not religious). For most people, having sex with anyone who asks for it is not an easy task.\n\n\nI am divided on prostitution - But I believe it should be decriminalized at least. My problem with regulating fully is that there's no evidence that it does solve the issues it promises to solve. \n\nIf you are open to changing your mind, read this \n\nhttp://www.embracedignity.org/uploads/10Reasons.pdf\n\nRegardless of who wrote it and which websites host that paper you should take a look. Most of all, my problem is that street prostitution, pimping, abuse and trafficking have not disappeared. Yes, health wise things are improving, but don't you think it's curious that a significant part of Amsterdam's prostitutes are foreigners/immigrants? Do you think it's ok that the majority of prostitutes according to many studies start before the age of 18? Do you think legalizing and regulating will erase issues? I'm not exactly concerned about bodily autonomy or stigmas, but with the workers themselves. The fact you need to do something to survive doesn't mean that activity is good for you. ",

        "text": "First of, this is only talking about people who are vegetarians/vegans for ethical reasons. If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply\n\nBeing a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat. Therefore, you need to get this money from elsewhere. This ultimately ends in a society having less money/resources, which they can give to the poor. Thus, you are kind of killing humans in trying to save animals. So vegetarians are basically putting other species of animals above their own, which I would say is objectively bad. \n\nOf course, this is not how society works, you are not directly killing people by being a vegetarian, but you are not directly helping animals either, so that is not an argument.\n\nI fail to see any argument against this. What about you?",
        "argument": "&gt;Being a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat.\n\nThis is an unsupported (and as far as I can tell, incorrect) assumption, and without it the rest of your **economic** argument falls apart.\n\nAnd I say economic because you are focused on the potential utility costs of the diet, but that's not what wholly goes into an **ethical** position, which your argument is supposed to be about (\"only talking about people who are vegetarians/vegans for ethical reasons\").\n\nAn ethical argument can be much more nuanced than straight up monetary utility.  As an easy example, many mentally and/or physically impaired people are overall drains on the economy -- is it ethical to kill them off to reallocate resources elsewhere?  What of the elderly or chronically ill?  If a vegetarian believes that right-to-life is a cornerstone of their ethical framework, and that animals should be afforded this right similar to humans, then they can ethically believe that animals should not be terminated even if society must bare some cost by changing diet.\n\nOf course, I think one would be hard pressed to support an argument that eating meat is cheaper than eating vegetarian.  There are plenty of dirt cheap vegetarian sources of cheap protein (such as rice&amp; beans, buckwheat, soy products, etc.), and a large segment of the impoverished world makes due with these staples and very little meat.",

        "text": "I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community. I have several gay friends and I am very informed about LGBT issues including transgenderism. I believe that conflicts of gender/identity/orientation etc. are innate and not a choice. \n\nI hold this belief because I feel as though this world will never be fully accepting of the LGBT community. It saddens me to see the statistics of [depression and suicide](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay#1) amongst youth in this group of people. LGBT kids are nearly 4x more likely to be depressed and suicidal than straight peers. The majority are bullied in school as well. Many of these people don't want to come out and have to live with this secret. Many of these people do come out and they are rejected. I understand that the world is a beautiful place because there are so many types of people. I also believe that we should make every effort to accept, love, and tolerate each other. However, we are only making these strides because people have always been and will always be born gay/bi/transgender etc. If this was not possible then this issue would never occur. Also, I am aware that many people in the LGBT community are proud to be gay. However, I can't help but feel as though they are embracing it because they have no other choice. I feel as though most (if not all) of these people must have had at least one dark moment where they felt different and wanted to be like everyone else.\n\nI would like to add that I am not supporting eugenics. I do not want to prohibit people who would be born with the gay gene from being born at all. I just want to remove the possibility of the person acquiring that gene. Furthermore, I do not wish to modify every single gene to make the perfect human beings. I am only speaking about this issue. Also, I would only encourage this if it could be done safely and would have no major side effects.\n\nEdit: My view has been changed and I am done replying. 80% of the counter-arguments were just bashing eugenics and that hardly changed my view at all. Look at the comment by /u/Miguelinileugim for a well-thought, original point.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "Logically speaking, if a \"gay gene\" exists, it would eliminate itself from the gene pool... eventually (naturally).\n\nGays don't reproduce naturally. Now if you are suggesting that gays shouldn't have the option to donate eggs/sperm in order to reproduce then you are perpetuating the culture you yourself are being demeaning off. \n\nNow let's just say you managed to change the culture associated with the hatred of the lgbt community entirely, and people really couldn't give a rats ass about who you love. In that case socio economics still limits the amount of gays that can afford to reproduce through the artificial insemination procedure. Eventually numbers would lower so much extinction would occur. \n\nAll in all, I don't believe there is a view to change here other than your approach. Since what your asking is taking place by natural selection, all I can say is your reasoning for wanting this to happen is encouraging of the existing culture to dislike the community. Your reasoning seems to accept the bad values that people hold and proposes a solution to live with those bad values. By that reasoning, if we can locate a gene that produces bigots and eliminate that, we could solve all race and discriminatory issues! Unfortunately that would leave us with hardly any humans left.  \n\nMy conclusion is that nature in this sense shouldn't be messed with. If it needs taking care of, it will take care of itself. Even cultural systems that perpetuate a bad practice for no apparent value eventually come to an end when they come face to face with a larger opposing view (I.e. Cortes and the Aztecs, or Chritians and the Moors (aka Islamics)). \n\nWhether you believe in eugenics or not, your reason advocates for it, and if you truly are sincere in not advocating it but still believe in eliminating a certain community, then at that point you really are just discriminatory towards that group and therefore not an ally as you so claim.\n\nThere is inconsistency with this post, and I hope that I've at least changed your concern towards the matter to a more cultural one that genetic one.",

        "text": "This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  \n\nMy wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  \n\nI hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    \n\nTL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  \n\nEdit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  \n\nEdit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  \n\nEdit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:\n\n1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  \n2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  \n3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   \n4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited\n5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  \n",
        "argument": "I think the blacks rights thing plays a big issue in this. It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. \n\nFor the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. \n\nAsians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population. It helps us get ahead as we are seen as \"smarter\" or \"hardworking\".  ",

I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.\n\nBoring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.\n\nThe NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.\n\nSo can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.",
        "argument": "MLB - It's a pass time, baseball is a long, slow grind that builds up gradually and doesn't matter much until the end of the season, this falls into your view of \"not mattering a whole lot\"\n\nNHL - Also my favorite sport, and depending on your team there are three categories that they'll fall into: Obviously making it into the playoffs (Chicago, Anaheim, Tampa, Pittsburgh). Obviously *not* making the playoffs (New Jersey, Arizona, Philadelphia, Toronto, whatever the expansion teams will be), and finally bubble teams (Ottowa, Columbus, Minnesota, Edmonton^maybe , Buffalo^maybe^unlikely )\n\nFor the \"gonna make it\" teams, there isn't much on the line other than home ice advantage, though that doesn't mean much, so the big thing is seeing the team progress and develop and making sure players are healthy, not terribly compelling.\n\nFor the bubble teams, this is where it gets interesting, you're talking about battles *all season long*, the wins *matter* when the team is only 2 points out of the wild card, the last 2 months of the season are frantic, with everyone trying to fight their way into the playoffs, for some people it's as good as playoff hockey from February on.\n\nFor the \"obviously not gonna make it\" teams, the regular season matters the *most* to them! It's all they have and if the team realizes it early enough and there's a highly touted prospect on the board next season (like Austin Matthews) it's incredibly important that the team does poorly. I'm a Sabres fan and this last season was one of the most tense and compelling I've watched in years, because they *needed* to finish last.\n\nSo in the NHL for the majority of the teams at least half of the regular season is extremely important for either making the playoffs, or getting into last for the best chance at the top draft pick.\n\nNFL - \n\nI saved this for last because I almost can't believe that you feel the games are important. There are only 16 games each season! Any single game can and does mean the difference between making the playoffs and going home at the end of December. \n\nEven if a team is bad games have *massive* implications because drafting is so important in the NFL.\n\nCompared to baseball or hockey, each NFL game counts for 10 baseball games, or 5 NHL games, all in one day! You have the majority of the games against teams that are constant rivals, that are battling for just 2 or 3 playoff spots available.\n\nSo much in the NFL can swing on one weekend that it's almost *too* important!\n\nTL:DR - I pretty much agree with baseball, but the NHL and especially the NFL every single game matters for most teams.",

        "text": "To get this out of the way early: **This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk.** An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. \n\nI'm talking strictly about advantages **in professional, competitive, skill-based, PvP shooters** given by playing at a lower resolution, taller aspect ratio (4:3 vs 16:9), or narrower FOV (excepting personal tolerance for distortion). \n\n[This is the photo that prompted my question.](http://i.imgur.com/9Lo87yI.jpg) There is absolutely NO WAY that playing at 1024x768 (and unless that's a 1440p monitor, I think it's reasonable to suspect it's actually 800x600) gives him ANY advantage, and is instead a handicap, but it's not uncommon for professionals to play this way (I'm thinking in particular of the CS:GO / CS:S scene). \n\n**Points of confusion:**\n\n* With upscaling disabled, the pixels are the same size as they would be if he were playing at native resolution, so there's no 'zoom' offered. \n* Lower resolution means, definitively, less rendering precision. If an enemy's head is visible over an edge at distance, it may not take up enough of the player's FOV to be rendered (possibly an unlikely example). Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p+ resolutions. \n* UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen.\n* Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio. Limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio. \n\n**Warrants** (I believe that's the appropriate term) **/ Assumptions:**\n\n^(^Read: ^\"These ^arguments ^are ^either ^completely ^ineffective ^\"against\" ^me ^or ^irrelevant ^to ^a ^sponsored ^professional.\")\n\n* No hardware limitations (GPU inadequacy, etc).\n* A competitor wants every advantage available to them, especially the legal/fair ones. \n* A professional recognizes that 'their way' might not be the best way, and would readily change for the sake of improvement.\n* Access to more information is always better. \n* Greater precision is always better. \n\nSo, why would anyone play at 800x600 or 1024x768? \"Because they're used to it\" seems to be the most common answer, but I feel like that's nothing but lazy and backwards.\n\n^(Please forgive any formatting mistakes; I'm on mobile. I'll correct them as soon as I get back to a desktop.)",
        "argument": "The fovea of your eye is a small part right in the center of your retina and field of vision. You have the clearest vision there, and it slowly deteriorates the farther you get away from there. If you want to have the best vision, you want to concentrate as much important information as possible directly into that spot. A smaller resolution allows for the entire game's field of vision to be in that small part of your eye that sees best.",

        "text": "Something I see come up a lot in music discussion threads, whether on Sputnik Music , /r/Music, or even a more niche sub like /r/PostHardcore, is that being very specific with genres is an annoying thing. This is an especially large joke in extreme metal discussions where there are multitudes of different sub-genres.\n\nI think these are great. If you like a band with a specific sound and you want to find more bands like them your best bet is to search for bands in the same genre. Being vague or broad with genres is a great way to not find more bands like the ones you're looking for.\n\nFor example, say I like Protest the Hero and want to find more bands like them. They have a lot of influences in their style but could be chalked up into the umbrella genre of \"metal.\" If I search \"metal\" I will get a *ton* of bands that sound absolutely nothing like Protest the Hero. Even narrowing it down to \"Progressive Metal\" still gets a lot of bands that aren't very similar, like Opeth. But if I search for \"Mathcore\" which is a lot more specific I can find bands that sound a lot like them.\n\nThere's no reason for the disdain of genres. No one complains about when movies get a million genre tags ([Example](http://i.gyazo.com/03027ec62e9f2efce7990a56ad3c79e2.png)) but when bands do they get annoyed and I can't see why. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "Context: I'm a staff writer for a few music websites (including Sputnik! I'm Brostep there), and I work a lot with electronic music.\n\nThere are two major arguments I see against being very specific with genres:\n\n1. Not all genres are, for lack of a better word, legitimate. There are certain genres, like the ones you've listed, which are generally agreed upon - I don't think there are many people who would argue that \"mathcore\" isn't legitimate. That said, there are other genres which are invoked very often, even though many, many people have argued compellingly that their very existence is kind of stupid. Take the whole dubstep sub-branching, for example. \"Dubstep\" is generally considered to be a legit genre - it's got quite a nice foundation in the London music scene, and people have been using it properly for a while. Same arguably goes for \"brostep\" (hence my username, though it's admittedly a touch tongue-in-cheek), which has been codified by enough well-established music blogs to have its existence justified. However, the dozens of other \"-step\" genres are the kinds of genres I would argue are not good at all. People who bandy about the terms \"chillstep,\" \"liquid dubstep,\" or \"trapstep\" (or, as we've seen in a few very public examples on /r/electronicmusic, \"Flumestep\" or \"feelstep\") are typically not the kind of people who have the scene-wide knowledge or experience to codify new genres of music, although they'll inevitably spread the word regardless. Thus, even though there's nothing really new being done (for example, Clubroot, Submotion Orchestra, and Phaeleh have all been doing what's called \"chillstep\" for years before that term was ever brought up), new, completely unnecessary genres are made up.\n\n2. Genres can be very terrifying for newbies. I know that Dev was pretty merciless when I started writing for Sput, especially since I'd been inoculated with these genres that people who'd been in the scene for more than a year or two didn't use for fairly obvious reasons, and I'm surprised I didn't stop trying to delve into electronic music then and there. There are a lot of people like me out there, too. If we're sticklers about excessive genrefication - for example, if someone tries to call a song \"drumstep\" and people berate him because it's really more just half-time drum &amp; bass - that'll scare away the people new to the general style (whether metal or electronic), meaning that a potential opportunity to find a lot of really, really cool music has been totally lost. I'm sure you've seen this in comment threads, where someone will jump in and proclaim his love for whatever the new metal subgenre du jour is and other users will jump all over him for being inexperienced, and he'll leave the site forever. If we're sticklers about genres, we'll lose a lot of potential listeners.\n\nSo, to reiterate: genres can be good. However, not all genres are good, and not all enforcing of genres is good. \"Disdain of genres\" in general is one thing (though I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone of serious musical experience who just wants to call everything \"metal\"), disdain of nonexistent genres (not mathcore, per se, but things like moombahcore and moombahstep) is another. And, of course, if we're too zealous in enforcing these genres (for example, if a user were to yell at someone for calling TTNG rock instead of math rock), we risk the destruction of a potential fanbase.",

If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. \n\nHowever, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. \n\nAre you overweight? Your fault. \n\nDo you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. \n\nAre you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. \n\nDo you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. \n\nDo you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their \"comfortable\"? Your fault. \n\nDo you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. \n\nDo you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. \n\nLadies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. \n\nDo you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. \n\nDo you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. \n\nMen, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. \n\nNearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics. \n\nAlso I am not saying being attractive is easy.

The experiment in the article provided these women with all the beauty treatments known to man, regardless of cost. Cost, and time, are important factors. Not everyone makes enough to afford the beauty treatments and fashionable clothing needed to make them at least a 7 out of 10. \n\nAre you arguing that it's their fault if they are poor, or just middle class? \n\nAlso, a lot of people are allergic to makeup -- I am. (And don't day there are hypoallergenic kind of makeup. That's more about marketing and much less about reality. And it's all expensive.) \n\nAnd flattering clothes are not cheap. Even if you can find them at thrift stores, it will take a long time. If you are raising children and working and perhaps caring for an elderly relative, you don't have time to comb through tons of items at Goodwill. \n\nIt might be a person's choice to take care of dependents rather than doll themselves up. But it's hardly their \"fault\" for not being able to look good without reneging on their responsibilities to others. \n\nYou're right that a large part of attractiveness is time and effort rather than genetics.

        "text": "I really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty!\n\nLet's start with why I find eating meat at all to be morally justifiable. I only buy meat from free-roam organic farms, which are clearly labeled here in Denmark. If I eat one of the cows I see on the outskirts of my city, happily roaming and eating grass, I don't really feel guilty. They get to experience a reasonably long, happy and healthy life. We also have pigs that are allowed to roam free in the forest. We give them a safe environment, and their lives end up on average longer and happier than they would be in the wild.\n\nSo imagine if an alien species came to earth and says: *\"Hey, we'll create a post-scarcity society for you. All your life you will be in perfect health. You (as in all humans) will never want for anything, you will get all your favorite food and you get to play video games all day or whatever it is you want to do. But when you reach the age of 50, we will kill you in a humane way and then we will eat your corpse.\"* I would find that to be a good deal. It would remove world hunger, there is no need to fight for resources. No diseases killing young people, no genetic defects. Not even having to work or do anything you don't want. And you would still get a reasonably long life to enjoy.\n\nAnd now we get to lamb meat. These guys are killed at 1 month to 1 year, which is in the best case less then 1/10th of their lives. They don't get to enjoy their lives. In my alien analogy, it would be like making the deal \"Yeah some of you get to live until 50, but some of you we will take and eat at 5\", which suddenly becomes less acceptable.\n\n**What would change my view:**\n\n* Somehow making my alien analogy work for eating humans at 5\n\n* Giving me another compelling moral argument for why eating lamb meat is ok.\n\n**What will NOT change my view:**\n\n* The \"Animals are made for human consumption so they don't matter\" argument. Well yes, but they are also intelligent agents capable of feeling pain and suffering. An alien species with superior technology and intelligence could decide that \"Humans are made for alien consumption\", and enslave our species, keeping us in cages all our lives. That would be horrible. So even if they are less intelligent and feel suffering differently, it does not give us the right to harm them for no good reason. We as a species get to decide which animals are for human consumption and which aren't, and what conditions we keep them in.\n\n* The \"we evolved to eat meat\" argument. Yes, and we can eat chicken, pork and beef. No need to eat lamb even if a vegetarian diet was insufficient. \n\nSorry for the long post. I realize it may be a bit tricky, but I really really want my guilt-free lamb roast. So there you have it, my first ever CMV :)\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the replies! So this has been addressed from 2 perspectives, that got me to change my view:\n\n1. If we go with the alien analogy, if they were to take some human cells and clone some humans on their home world, let them play happily on a field until they are 5, and then slaughter them for food, how immoral would that really be? The children would accept it as the status-quo and enjoy their lives, as they are too young to understand all the ramifications. No parents would have to part from their children, thus causing more suffering. \n\n2. On the other side, it has been shown that other animals are slaughtered at an even younger age, so my view is inconsistent. Pigs, who are a lot more intelligent than lambs, usually get killed at 5 months. Milk cows are parted from their young as soon as they are born, and the calves get killed quite often only after a few weeks.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else\". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.\n\nSecondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.\n\nThe final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase \"freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences\" does not. \n\nEdit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit.\n\nSome people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.\n\nEdit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm *not* saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them.\n\nA lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.\n\n/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses. If you want to see my argument in comic form, you couldn't get much closer than that.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You can say whatever you want. You can't however say what you want and expect others not to react to your words. I can't go to my friends house and say that his wife is a cunt and expect to be invited over next week. I can't tell my employer that I feel that black people are inferior to whites and then expect to represent my boss by wearing his company's name badge to work. \n\nYou are asking for speech with no consequences.

        "text": "I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.\n\nFirst, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.\n\nSecond, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says \"Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . .\" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.\n\nSanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.\n\nForcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sanders is the largest supporter of their movement currently running and they decided to attack his rally.

This doesn't work as well for Sanders because we know what his plans are and he has support for it, but this would have been great against Hillary or Trump as they haven't put much focus on the issue and their response to it could sway many people's opinions on their campaigns.",

        "title": "CMV: If straight and cis people attend a Pride parade, they should spend some of their time there volunteering.",
        "text": "Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.\n\nI personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a \"Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!\"\n\nAnd, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are \"showing\" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.\n\nThis is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.\n\ntl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.\n\n**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and \"gotchas.\"  \n\nA crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.\n\nThis is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.

I believe you can be a man or a woman or trans, and you can be any sexual orientation you want under the rainbow! Every persons orientation is a little nuanced. I don't believe you're gender can be nuanced. You are a man or a woman, whether you were born that way or you underwent physical changes later in life because you knew deep down that you were a man/woman under the skin you were born in. I don't believe you can make a daily choice to identify as a different gender. So you are a girl who hates skirts? You aren't a man because of that, you are just a girl who hates skirts. Not conforming to gender roles doesn't mean that you have the choice to identify yourself as a different gender whenever you please.   \nWhen a trans person switches, they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to legally be a gender. If we recognized \"gender fluidity\" all sorts of problems could arise, such as \"which change room should I use?\". Would it just change depending on how they were feeling that day? Would we all be okay with men, deciding that they are more of a woman today, going into female change rooms and stripping down in front of children?  \nI don't believe that people really feel the need to change their genders on a daily basis, and I don't agree with those who would try to force me to respect their \"fluid\" gender. There is already a term for people who don't conform to gender stereotypes and it's androgyny. I consider myself to be a very open person, especially when it comes to other peoples personal choices that don't affect me so please CMV.  \nEDIT: u/Paimon has changed my view about gender fluidity being a thing. It's a thing. I still disagree with most of you saying there are no legal or social ramifications though, especially about the change rooms, and on how to address someone who is gender fluid.    \nEDIT 2: A lot of people are trying to change my view based on what they think the world should be like (i.e gender neutral bathrooms and change rooms) rather than being realistic about what it actually is (women have to be guarded in order to protect themselves from sexual harassment.) I still don't believe that men with biological man parts should be allowed to waltz into a women's change room because they are feeling like a woman that day, and that I should just trust that they know better than I do what their gender is when their dick is in my face.  \nThat being said I understand how they is a good term over he/she. It sounds weird to call a girl a they but if someone asked me to refer to them that way, obviously I would. ",
        "argument": "I am by no means an expert, I've just been really interested in gender/sexuality issues for a while and I'll explain it how it makes sense to me. So please if someone is reading this and I am wrong, correct me please!! \n\nI look at this in 3 categories: sex, gender, and sexuality. I see sex as being your physical situation, sexuality being who you are attracted to, and gender being how you feel inside. Sex, to me, can be male, female, intersex, or any combination thereof. This is fairly straightforward and there aren't many arguments about this, I think.\n\nSexuality is the next easiest one, and it seems like you understand this one pretty similarly to how I do. A little nuance here is the separation of sexual attraction and romantic attraction, so for example you can want to be romantic with people but totally uninterested in sex (heteroromantic, asexual). These two things are important in defining gender.\n\nI'm gonna talk about transgender people for a minute as a preface to gender. Generally, transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, which is recognized in the [DSM-V](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) (it used to be called gender identity disorder until this edition of the DSM), and take steps to alleviate it by either transitioning (hormones, surgery) or presenting (binders, makeup, clothes) as another gender. Transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, and more often than not, they have serious body dysphoria as well,  where they feel disgusted by their bodies or just feeling \"wrong\" in their skin. It's a horrible place to be mentally and can lead to serious depression and self harm. That's why hormone replacement therapy is important, because it tries to eliminate body dysphoria or at least tone it down a few notches. I bring this up because gender fluidity is basically the same thing, except gender fluid people either do not have body dysphoria or they do not experience it to the same degree. They have the same feelings of \"wrongness\" about aligning their gender with their sex, and personally I think this has a lot to do with how pervasive gender roles are in society.  \n\nThere are *lots* of classes of gender fluidity, and while some of them are fluid on a day-to-day basis like you described, the more common varieties tend to sit somewhere in the middle. The [Genderbread Person](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/) (with a more in-depth explanation [here](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/)) is a really awesome illustration that you can play around with. It's a combination of identity (how you feel) and expression (how you present), using socially defined gender norms of femininity and masculinity.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is, when we are looking at issues like restrooms or changing rooms, is that individuals who are genderfluid are not \"men going in a women's bathroom\" or \"women in a man's changing room,\" because I feel like that has more of a predatory connotation. It's really up to the individual which one they want to use. In my opinion, changing rooms are not a big deal, but restrooms go by what you present as (ex. if you are a trans-man, you use a stall in the men's restroom). (As mentioned in another comment, gender neutral restrooms are the best way to solve this I think, and more and more public places are starting to implement them which is really awesome!!)\n\nThe way I look at it is like, since hormone therapy requires recommendations from doctors and therapists, legally identifying as genderfluid should be managed the same way.",

Now, I know both of these examples aren't perfect opposites, but the reception has been wildly different. When Michael B. Jordan was cast as the new Human Torch, people were thrilled. Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch), people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting \"culturally insensitive,\" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her \"unlikely heritage,\" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 1/4 Chinese heritage.\n\nI don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor \"insensitive?\"\n\nI'd love to hear other thoughts.

What if only the men who are comfortable sharing their face share and everyone else is filtered out?  Those people then go elsewhere if they need to share their body.  In what way would that be invasive or sexist?\n\nAlso, I think it comes down to supply and demand.  In every dating site, I have heard female friends say that they receive pictures of guy's dicks.  Disembodied dicks have flooded the market and they are just not very much of an offering for a subreddit.  In contrast, women don't send pictures of themselves as often.  So /r/gonewild can be alluring without having the same demands.  \n\nYes, the sexes are treated differently, but I don't see how it is sexist.  The difference in treatment comes as a response from a contextual behavior, not as an oppression.  ",

        "text": "Crossposted from a comment on /r/skeptic\n\nI've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of vitriol on both sides. The mythicists take umbrage at being dismissed as amateurs and dabblers and vociferously defend their hypotheses, the historicists take umbrage at the strenuous attacks, and it all gets very torrid very quickly, and becomes very difficult to actually analyze the actual strength of the arguments.\n\nSo, as a skeptic, I'm sufficiently intrigued by the Mythicist arguments to profess agnosticism as to the Historical Jesus, for the following reasons:\n\n* There are no extrabiblical attestations of any significant event from the life of Jesus. On the contrary, events such as the slaughter of the innocents, the census of all the Empire are clearly fictitious, and multiple miracles, the triumphal entry to Jerusalem, and multiple events surrounding the crucifixion are absent from all historical records when there's a reasonable chance that some account of them would have survived, had they occurred at all.\n*  The synoptic problem indicates that we are working from at most one source that even approaches being primary, and even that most likely written much later, anonymously, and as hagiography rather than history.\n*  Well into the third century, pagan sources mostly recount the existence of Christians and document the claims of Christians. This is at best hearsay.\n* attempts to reconstruct the \"real\" historical Jesus are invariably unprovable and contradictory with one another--there is no consensus.\n* While the vast bulk of NT scholarship presumes an historical Jesus, the \"scholarly consensus\" should be given less weight since for centuries, such research has been largely a devotional undertaking. Jesus mythicism is very nearly literally heretical, as well as figuratively. At least sufficiently that it deserves consideration even though a strong consensus exists that contradicts it.\n\n\nSo, we accept the historical reality of many persons throughout ancient history based on much less proof than gospels and various other pagan mentions. So maybe there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition. But the problems above mean A) we know nothing about him and B) almost everything written about him is unknowable or outright fictitious.\n\n\nI look at it as the difference between \"Abraham Lincoln\" and \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\" Notwithstanding that there is an historical person that was the basis, the hero version is a myth.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "title": "CMV: Women and Men (who are both heterosexual) cannot be platonic friends and are using each other, in most cases. And I find it unnecessary baggage within a relationship.",
        "text": "I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal when I wasn't in a relationship and I would just turn them down. Once I was, they all tried much harder than usual to pursue something whereas before it was a more passive attempt. Once they realized I was \"off the table\" of sorts and was serious about my now boyfriend, the relationship just dwindled despite my continuing to talk to them just as much as before. I realized this was because the conversation would always be very short due to me not replying to flirtatious texts which probably got really boring for them. \n\nWhat I mean by men and women cannot be just friends is that one or the other (possibly both), even if not having a physical relationship, is using each other for the ego boost that comes with someone of the opposite sex giving you attention and would under other circumstances, definitely hook up (or maybe at one point in time already have).  I also noticed even women who have a lot of male friends they spent a lot of time with and \"friend zoned\" them, they would still get weird and upset if the man was in a romantic relationship and therefore had less time to expend for her because it was going to his SO. This doesn't happen with their male friends as long as they see them enough because the male friends aren't using their male friends to feel attractive.. but suddenly \"just\" female friends tend to get very territorial once they aren't getting the attention from the male friend that they were used to or able to get that constant validation. \n\nOf course there will ALWAYS be exceptions. But I think, on average, this all proves to be true. This is also why I am pretty uncomfortable with my boyfriend having female friends that aren't also people I've met and felt comfortable with. He can, of course, but it makes me feel uncomfortable. The one he introduced me to automatically displayed the classic signs of using him for attention and being very touchy but pretending it's simply a \"brother\" like relationship. I would like to be comfortable with such friendships but it seems unnecessary to me within a relationship. In a group setting is fine, of course, as long as everyone is comfortable (which doesn't seem to happen if the friend has been in the persons life longer than the SO) but I am talking about opposite sex friendships when one or both parties are in a relationship with other people...I feel they have no reason to spend a lot of time interacting or spending time together one-on-one unless they are both lying to each other (or one person is) and hoping that something will happen (sexually or otherwise) without admitting it to themselves or like the [in my opinion] inappropriate feeling of playing with fire. \n\nI hold myself to the same standard, of course. My one male friend that has not tried anything was also my roommate but I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even. We would hang out alone sometimes but in public (during daytime) or just while one or the other is in the kitchen cooking. I don't think anything would happen if we did drink alone, as we have before I was dating my boyfriend, but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway. I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me. This is ONE of those exceptions out of the plenty of male friends who out of nowhere have tried to hook up or tell me they have feelings for me and I suspect is not the average dynamic of a male-female friendship. So while I think it MAY be possible, it is somewhat rare. \n\nObviously my view also applies to those who are strictly in monogamous relationships.\n\nTl;dr: \nMost men who have female \"platonic\" friends would sleep with them if the opportunity arose and if are in a relationship, only keep them around in case and because of the ego boost of being around women who aren't unattractive (to feel wanted). Most women who have male \"platonic\" friends are using them for the attention they get by feeling a man likes them, and can't have them to feel like a sought-after, high quality woman...and also get jealous when they begin dating a woman despite their \"just friend\" claims. always exceptions, but believe this to be generally true. ",
        "argument": "If I understand you correctly, your view is that with a few exceptions, men always want sex from women and that women always want attention from men, and that while they can be friends, that friendship is incompatible with a relationship that either of the friends may be in.\n\nIt seems that your view is based solely in your own experiences, which in itself is not a bad thing, I think most people form their views in a similar fashion. The issue I have with this case is that, after having read responses to your view, and your responses to them, you don't seem willing to accept that anyone else's reasoning is as sound as your past experiences. Whenever someone makes an argument that your view is flawed, you respond with an exception, the issue is always that they have misunderstood you, not that you don't agree with their logic.\n\nI have two points to make about this, the first is that it doesn't appear, to me, that you are willing to have your view changed. I think that you are certain that your experiences are characteristic of any interaction between any man and any woman. Which leads me to my second point, perhaps the relationships you base your view upon are flawed. If all of your male friends only want to sleep with you and have no other motives for being your friend then that  specific relationship is what is wrong, not every relationship between two platonic friends.\n\nI'd like to add that I haven't meant any of this to be condescending to you, but in my experience, addressing the reason that I don't think opposing views are able to penetrate someone's beliefs is an effective way of moving a discussion forward in a meaningful manner.",

Society and sound government requires taxes and I think it's absolutely fair to have taxes on income, sales, purchases, whatever. But for government to come in when a dying person passes on their belongings or money to someone they care about and snatch away a piece of it is a step too far.\n\nI am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax. However since Spain is in recession it is extremely difficult to sell the house, and some people are forced to forfeit the property in order to be aligned with the law. This is not the basis of my belief, but it is what motivated me to post this to CMV.\n\nI want someone to give me a good reason to CMV since I think taxes are overall a positive thing. This is just one instance I think is outrageous.\n\n**TL; DR** I understand the need for and support taxation but I cannot support government interference in a dying person's gift to another person. CMV!\n\nEDIT: A few people are bringing up the situation in the US, where inheritance tax doesn't apply to amounts under 5 and a half million. That's fine. Well done USA. But just because it's adjusted and applied like that in the US doesn't make the concept any more agreeable when used throughout the rest of the world. I am not interested in talking about the US example if your argument is based around \"the US has this special set of circumstances and therefore the tax is ok\".\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Not taxing the rich has long term implications for stability and peace within your society that are not pleasant.\n\nThe question is how to properly design an inheritance tax. It sounds like Spain starts progressively taxing inheritances starting at anything over ~8000 pounds. The US starts taxing inheritances at anything over $5 million. Spain's tax hits most people. The US's tax only hits the truly wealthy. There are other ways to design an inheritance tax, perhaps the problem isn't inheritance taxes, but Spain's inheritance tax?",

        "argument": "All of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility. It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.\n\nTo look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. \n\nAs for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population.

The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.\n\n\nPoint 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx\nThe ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.\n\nPoint 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.\n\nPoint 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. \n\nPoint 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.",
        "argument": "At the moment, in most states, the requirement to vote is to fill out a card asserting you are eligible.  It is up to the state to show that you are not eligible.  The burden of proof is on the state to prove whether you are or are not eligible.\n\nWith a mandatory voter ID, you've moved the burden of proof onto the citizen to prove that they are eligible to vote.  They have to have proof of a birth certificate, social security card, utility bill, or some other form of proof.  With elderly or poor people, they may not have these documents available, and voter ID has passed the burden of proof onto the voter.\n\nHaving or not having an ID doesn't make a significant difference in voting lines.  At least in my experience, the bottleneck is almost always the booths themselves, not the sign-in portion.  If you want to make voting more accessible, move to a 24 hour voting period.  I think that would be even better than declaring voting day a holiday - if you run elections from 7 PM to 7 PM or whatever, then even part-time workers with multiple jobs should have some time to vote.",

And if it doesn't matter, it's not meaningful.\n\n\nI'd love to be wrong on this one, so go ahead and change my view.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "So, I think \"meaning\" is kind of just a byproduct of our evolution. Because, the way you're talking about it is sort of the way most people address this concept, like it's some sort of transcendent sentiment, that there's a purpose that can exist forever and we're not a part of it and that eternal purpose is the only important thing.\n\nBut, I mean, that's just some feeling that we have, like envy or boredom. \"Meaning\" the concept as opposed to \"meaning\" the feeling, as far as I can see, has no need to be attached or correlated to some arbitrary concept like \"time.\"\n\nYou know when you're sorta YouTube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we've done in the last decade sometimes? Or sometimes, it's the opposite, but often, you'll watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (EDIT: So re-reading this, I realized that at this part, I accidentally did it in the same order twice so it's not the opposite at all but I'm sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name)\n\nOne of those videos I watched, I think, was about what's outside our observable universe. It started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like \"meh\" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our \"forward\" in time is \"up\" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.\n\nLike, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.\n\n###So...\n___\n\nBeing dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.\n\nMy take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.\n\nThat's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.\n\nI'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that\n\n###TL;DR (Honestly, don't read the above, it's a ramble because I fucked up and I'm too lazy to fix it)\n\n\"not lasting forever means we're meaningless\" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. It's just, like, another thing. Like a burger. It's like saying if I don't always have everything to do with this burger, I am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. Why a burger? Why not a sandwich? Or a late night television show? At the very least, if we're meaningless, it's not because we won't last forever.",

        "text": "Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 600s. \n\nIslam is not only out of date, dangerous to today's society and subversive, but it has always been a violent religion. This would be fine if Islam could be reformed. But that's the trouble with Islam. It has not been widely reformed and I'm afraid it cannot be due to its structure. Sure, it has a similar structure\n\nThe concept of Dar-al-harb/Garb/Kufr (War, War(ottoman),Infidel) and the Dar-al-Islam (Islam/Peace) is one that divides the world into two; nations that follow the law of Islam (Shariah) and those that don't. Before you say that this practice is outdated and out of style, please look at Salafis, the extremist groups in the middle east, and [this fine fellow and other people like him that do not classify as salafis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV710c1dgpU). Even if the Quran is not taken literally, Shariah law still applies. I have lived in an Islamic country. You do not need to take the Hadith and Quran literally to be subject to literal Shariah law.\n\nRead here:\n&gt;Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively small role in defining the laws on the country. It only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts has jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states there are sharia criminal laws, for example there is the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 5000, and imprisonment to not more than 3 years. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law\n\nYou can literally go to jail for renouncing Islam. It's far more serious in countries like Saudi Arabia, and 4 in 10 muslims in the UK want to establish Shariah law. In fact, there are 85 shariah law courthouses in the UK which run by court-approval basis. I personally believe that the political stress plus the fact that both parties signed an agreement to be judged by shariah law makes every case a stamp-and-go case. Before you say that both if both parties consent to it, it's alright, please think about the cultural and familial pressure of Islam and their treatment of women.\n\nWe must not forget Islam's borderline slavery of women. They are covered, silenced, veiled, separated, and treated as commodity. God willing, they at least inherit half the amount a man of the same level of descendence would.\n\nI do not say that muslims are bad people and must convert to be part of today's society. I do not say that at all. In fact, I say the opposite. If anything can stop the self-indulgent hedonism of today's society it is Muslims (And Sikhs). I just say that Islam conflicts with today's society, and it cannot be wholly compatible with today's world. I do not approve of Islam. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "&gt;is a harm to the structure of the status quo.\n\nMany people (especially in areas where there is a high density of religious people) feel the same way about bisexuals, so I don't think that you can claim that something which is different is a \"harm to the structure of the status quo\" in a negative sense. Every \"progressive movement\" could be viewed in the same way, but I'm sure you'd agree that this can be a positive thing even that it goes against the \"status quo\".\n\n1. Not sure how this backs up your point. You're arguing (I think) that utility implies acceptability. If a religion fights something \"bad\" then it is \"okay\" (where \"bad\" is based on an arbitrary definition restricted by time and location (fancy way of saying your \"bad\" is different to 1940's KKK's \"bad\")). Or if you're are arguing the way in which it is fighting now means that it is no longer acceptable, then almost every ideal should have been abandoned (if a feminist fights for feminism \"incorrectly\", then should feminism be abandoned? I say no.)\n\n2. Yes, I am looking at scripture and history since you are looking at current Islam and the Quran. Urban II: Letter of Instruction to the Crusaders, December 1095 - \"If, moreover, there are any of your people whom God has inspired to this vow, let them know that he (Adhemar) will set out with the aid of God on the day of the Assumption of the Blessed Mary, and that they can then attach themselves to his following.\" [Source](http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_PopeUrbanClermontSpeech.aspx).\n\n3. So preserve the status quo (regardless of it's oppressiveness) to maintain stability? Then all Islamic countries should keep Islam in to maintain stability. Therefore, it is not outdated. It is just not beneficial to countries where Muslims are a minority. Additionally, you cannot argue this while arguing against the way women are treated in Muslim countries since this is their \"status quo\". Also by extension, since we don't want to abolish the \"status quo\", then we can't get rid of Islam and we can't get rid of the resulting conflict since it is currently the \"status quo\".\n\n4. Yes, Christianity is...ahem...evolving, but evolution takes time. If you looked at Christianity at one given point in time (as you are currently doing with Islam), Christianity falls well short of being beneficial or even harmless. \n &gt;you are generalising\n Yes, I am generalising. But you aren't??\n &gt;It is now just a war-torn, dangerous veteran.\n\n Largest Christian country (by total Christians): USA. Largest Muslim country (by total Muslims): Indonesia. Which country is currently at war and which is not? \"But that's just two countries!\" Either I generalise or I risk making the sample size too small.\n\n&gt;Islam definitely had its use.\n \nAgain, you are subscribing to the utility of a religion, which relies solely on your opinion of what a \"good\" goal is. If your goal was peace under Sharia law, Islam is the perfect religion!",

These include genetic differences, and differences in the brain.\n\n**Genetic differences found only in trans individuals:**\n\nMtF Trans individuals have been found to have genetic differences that cause their biology to bind testosterone differently than males.\n\n&gt;The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.\n\n**Brain structure differences found only in trans individuals:**\n\n&gt;Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender.\n\nand\n\n&gt;The interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.\n\n**Prenatal androgen exposure:**\n\n&gt;Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females\n\nSo no, they were not \"technically their own original gender\", because their original biological characteristics did not conform to a typical member of their supposed previous sex in the first place.\n\nDoes this help change your view?\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism)",

A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education).\n\nI appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a 'graduation' stands for. **There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions**\n\nTo give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.\n\nMy son is supposed to have a 'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place.

Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. \nCan I \"pursue happiness\" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers?

        "argument": "I'm not here to completely change your mind. On the responsibilities note:\n\nMy understanding of rights-based political philosophy is that rights are the bare minimum of what peoples generally agree on as the bare minimum of requirements for people to be able to pursue something like freedom or a good life. Rights aren't enabling you to do anything - they are restricting the government from interfering in your life. (The most cited example of this misunderstanding in the US is people who say ridiculous things and then cite the first amendment of the US constitution- the first amendment limits government censorship - not fellow citizens.)\n\nThe responsibilities bit is not brought up because (1) it is presupposed that most people won't step-up and (2) taking responsibility in open society has its own rewards. So on the first note, guess what there were drunks/deadbeats/dropouts in every day and age - and so you know that some people aren't even capable of a full public life (ie voting, volunteering, getting involved in the community, stepping up at work, etc, etc). Also, to be fair, a lot political philosophy was only about property-owning men - their very lives were based on their supremacy over everyone else. So for instance, you couldn't argue that non-property owning men and women would have public responsibilities because it would undermine the mental model of inferior women and non-property owners.\n\nPoint two, where responsibility is its own reward:\nThe other aspect of it is that it was assumed that if you became part of public society you got to do all these other fun things: dances, you could network for your job or future wife, meet interesting people, potentially take political office, siphon public funds etc etc.\n\nThe rights model is based on a morally-normative model and is therefore problematic. But this was known quite a long time ago: even Spinoza's (mid-1600's) political philosophy, more or less, replaces rights with abilities and interest.\n\nBut all philosophy aside- what is of dire interest to me is why Americans seem to be (1) uninterested in history and or (2) unwilling to hold our government to the basic principles of both our constitution and our founding.\n\nIt's very interesting to me that people rationalize government misdeeds and overreaches - or make ironic jokes about them. (\"I'm sure I'm on a list somewhere.\") Or they may simply shrug and say: \"They are only catching the bad guys.\" As if that isn't how every horrifying misdeed starts or somehow makes it better that they lied to American congress.\n\nTL;DR: You are right, rights aren't alright.

The 'by-the-book' clubs don't allow clients to have sex with the strippers, though of course it most likely happens a lot and many strippers are prostitutes, but not all. The two jobs aren't all that dissimilar (sex work), though stripping is more of an art and I imagine the best performers take it quite seriously and don't sell themselves (cheaply).\n\nOn the client side, I think the only reason strip clubs came to be is due to a crackdown on 'out in the open' brothels and the type of men who would go to a strip club would also go to a brothel if they didn't feel like criminals. If brothels were legalized I can see some of those businesses eventually reaching a similar level of social acceptance, thus brothels will become more than a series of dark rooms full of sex-slaves and may become the amusing harems and menageries of historical fiction. \n\nI find that not only will clients prefer the legal brothel with a nice entertainment budget. Why just go watch a girl dance around naked? Why not touch her as you like and even have sex? Or watch people have sex etc. The type of men who regularly go to strip clubs most likely only go because they cant get attractive women to pay attention to them and are willing to deal with teasing and stripping because an illegal brothel can result in infections or jail time. \n\nI even suspect that the performers will end up working in brothels rather than strip clubs. Seeing as there are women who will have sex with them without legal repercussions men won't throw as much money at a girl who is just taking her clothes off. No doubt brothels will end up having some of the girls strip to entice clients to go into the back rooms with them. The artistic side of stripping, which only exists due to the illegality of brothels and male willingness to throw money at attractive women, will lose a great deal of funding and talent. \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The complexity in a toilet provides a way to shield sewer gasses from coming back up into the restroom. It's not a perfect system but it's better than up against a tree in the woods.  ",

        "text": "As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic.  While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product.  An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast.  \n\nUnfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately.  This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes.  Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes.  Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos.  \nRaising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation.\n\nIn addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back.  Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control.  On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle.\n\nUnfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them.  The only viable solution as I see it would be not to tax food, but rather pants, say by $5-10 per inch the waistline is larger than the inseam.  This would ensure that only the fat would have to pay fat taxes.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

        "text": "Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.\n\nEdit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nCops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.\n\n[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nMost states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nCops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.\n\n[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.\n\n[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.\n\nIt appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.\n\nFifth Amendment\n\nCops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nYou can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).\n\n[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.\n\n[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.\n\n[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nSome Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.\n\nI'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.\n\n[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.\n\n[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.\n\nEvery year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.\n\nIt might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?\n\nWell it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.\n\nIf you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.\n\nI'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.\n\n**Edited to link some sources**\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "\n(Edit) sorry for the wall of text, am on mobile so formatting is hard.\nWell there are several things wrong with your points.\n1) Civil Forfeiture is still bound by the normal judiciary system. You can in fact get your money back, although most don't. Civil forfeiture is also only used in the case of individuals carrying large amounts of cash, and that of course is the asset most commonly linked to criminal activity. It would be harder to sizes and easier to win back non cash assets.\n2) police have always broken up protests that don't have a permit or occur in non designated areas. This isn't characteristic of a police state by itself. This has gone on in New York since the 1800s, it's nothing new. While current restrictions of protests to limited areas may reduce the impacts protests may have, they are orders of magnitude less harsh than common measures in police states.\n3) bail is as high as it is because it is the cost te state would have to pay a bounty hunter to bring you back. Obviously this is quite expensive, and disproportionately impacts poor people, but there's a quite logical reason why this system exists. This system was not implemented as part of some nefarious plot, it is just a holdover from the olden days, the very earliest days of the country. That also proves that bail requirements are constitutional, our founders approved of them and wrote them into las. Fact is poor people have never been able to afford bail for major crimes,the current situation is the same as it always was. \n4) testimony obtained under duress is not admissible in court. Also if an officer frequently arrests people without cause he will be disiplined by his department. \n5) officers are allowed to arrest and or search people without warrants, such are arrests or searches must be based on the officers reasonable suspecion that the person in question is a criminal. I mean if I was walking down the street in NYC smoking crack, if the cop had to go back and get a warrant he would never be able to find me again. Of course  many cases are less clear cut then this, especially the searches, but it's necessary for the police to have these powers in order for them to properly persecute criminals. \n5) I think your primary problem though is scale. Sure the United States might be more repressive then some other democracies, but is it a police state? Of course not, you hear varied political views on TV, we are allowed to discuss public policy on the internet or in the street, I can oppose the government without fear of being disappeared. If the US was a police state far more dissidents would disappear every year, and political freedoms would be da more restricted. \n",

I've created a bookbottle!\"\n\nThe object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.\n\nUnunpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds.

        "argument": "The issue with taxes are the impact it has on the person you're taxing. Firstly, a 15% flat tax would be a significant decrease in tax revenues, so that's unrealistically low.\n\nThe issue with taxes is what activity are the people you're taxing giving up to pay for the taxes. The more someone earns, the more likely that paying taxes is only cutting into luxury expenses. Currently, the bottom 20% of earners pay a total tax rate of about 8%, so you're essentially doubling the taxes on poor people. This is taking money out of budgets for food, housing, and basic expenses. When you're making $20k per year, losing another 8% of your income to taxes is devastating. If you're making $500k per year, a tax cut means you maybe take extra nice vacations or buy the biggest Mercedes instead of the 2nd biggest. Additionally, spending on basic stuff is most beneficial to the economy. Tax cuts for lower income people generate more economic activity than tax cuts for wealthy people. Any time you're generating economic growth, you're also growing future tax revenues, so cutting taxes for poor people ultimately allows you to lower the overall tax burden.\n\nTaxing lower income people has a much larger effect on children. Lowering a families ability to invest in essential things for their kids leads to lower educational achievement, higher rates of behavioral problems and crime, etc. These all have a steep economic cost down the road.\n\n&gt;It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.\n\nThere is no point in our tax system where making more money results in you taking less home. The top marginal rate is less than 40%. You get to keep a bit less of that extra dollar, but you always have more to spend when you make more money. Additionally, consider that after a certain income all your basic expenses are met, and any additional money you make is 100% disposable. \n\n&gt;but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the US economy instead of finding ways around the tax code\n\nInvestments are taxed as capital gains, which are flat as you have described. A flat tax does nothing to discourage seeking ways around taxes. If you have $100 k, and the tax is 15%, as long as you can avoid the tax for less than $15k, you're going to do it because at the end of the day you end up with more money.",

        "text": "Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies!\n\n\nWhile having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the movie never came up, so I will preface this post by saying I haven't actually seen said movie) in which a black student at an Ivy league school started a radio station directed at \"White People\", during this conversation a couple of things came up such as how the black students disapproved of a house of only black students being changed in the future so that students would mix normally (which sounds to me like an attempt to abolish outdated segregatory measures- although again I haven't seen the movie).\n\n\nThis is the context of my post- apparently this film culminates with a party in which people are invited to show up dressed as stereotypical elements of culture framed in an attempt to trap the students into going to a party founded on fundamentally racist ideals. The movie then ends with clips from colleges over America having these kinds of parties. Now I can't imagine many people are foreign to party themes which now could be labelled as cultural appropriation- the most common being \"Cowboys and Indians\" which are nowadays quick to be labelled as **racist**. \n\nI guess I come to the opinion in my title from several ideas which probably all need to be challenged to change the view to which they lead. \n\n1- Displaying stereotypes for any purpose (even one as basic as to have a good time) ultimately does no harm, causing offense or even in extreme cases devaluing the root culture (although I would dispute that) is not the same as racism which is a prejudice against another person due to the colour of their skin- there is no discrimination here, other than bruised feelings no harm is done, Stereotypes are used in comedy against pretty much every imaginable definable group. \n\n2- Britain (arguably more so than America) is a cultural melting pot, appropriation goes both ways- India started playing Cricket for example, the person I was on the phone with raised the point that appropriation is particularly when something is taken from a culture without giving a contribution back to the culture from which it was taken- which makes sense. However I would argue that the use of stereotypes in this way is not taking anything from the culture in the first place- stereotypes only occasionally reflect current cultures often far removed from the circumstance of their use. It would be like arguing against a BDSM theme for a party because we are taking from that sub-culture without contributing anything (Before people jump out and point out the strawman here those involved in the BDSM community have faced a persecution and prejudice for their activities which although are changeable- which skin colour is not in most cases the basic premise is still close enough to be metaphorically accurate) \n\n3- Cultures benefit from cultural appropriation- it raises awareness and increases immersion in the native culture. \n\nCMV\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "Nobody really cares about an honest exhange of culture. That's not really cultural appropriation.\n\nPeople get bent out of shape about it when people take bits and pieces of a culture out of context, without understanding it. Then, usually, those contextless items are commodified without the originating culture's consent or benefit.\n\nImagine the following scerario: some aliens decide to drop in on humanity, and they decide to wear coture dresses with pope hats and sneakers because they like keeping their jimmies cool, value comfort, and that's just a nice hat. Everybody everywhere would be snickering at their choice, but they would haughtily remind us that they are the more advanced species, so they are doing it right. Meanwhile, they take their dresses and pope hats back to the central galaxy and make more money than the earth is worth on their \"fantastic artisanship\" that they totally didn't just take directly from a Payless store. Earth remains disconnected from the galactic sphere, and all the dubbed virtual reality simulations they *do* send us back portray aliens dressed up as \"humans\" in their dresses and pope hats, and we all like cheese because the aliens found that hilarious. Those coture dresses are dismissed as 'tribal costumes' and we are the backward butts of jokes -- not the people who wore a damn pope hat and sneakers and called it 'cool'.\n\nOkay, so that's pretty absurd, but that's exactly what we tend to do to other cultures right here on earth.\n\nTo bring it back to your original BDSM party example, if people culturally appropriated from BDSM culture, it would suck. It would consist of taking things out of context, not caring about the important underlying things that make BDSM safe(r) and getting it (likely deadly) wrong. People would end up going to the hospital because they didn't know how to tie the ropes right, and didn't think it important to learn how before their hand turned black from constriction or something. They'd do things like wear a locking gag without having a safe command (like, \"hey spotter, if I pound my fist three times, that means break out the emergency shears and get this thing off me!\") so they end up choking to death. Now, everybody forms the opinion that BDSM is unsafe and should be banned, because just look at what happened!? *Obviously* that culture has something horribly wrong with it.

        "title": "CMV: There is nothing wrong with requiring (medically-appropriate) vaccination for children to attend public schools",
        "text": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:\n\n1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.\n\n2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.\n\n3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...\n\n4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.\n\nWhat would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.\n\nEdit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it \"should have\" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.\n\nEdit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.\n\nEdit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table.",
        "argument": "As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. \n\nNow, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. \n\nSo, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school? Personally, that is not something I'm willing to do, so I'm against mandatory vaccination in order to go to school.",

        "argument": "&gt;McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F **(which is no different than most other restaurants)**\n\nThis is factually incorrect.

Research also indicated that such a temperature difference makes a massive difference in the amount of time needed for said coffee to cause burns and therefore the dangers associated with the drink.\n\nSuch a difference between McDonald's coffee and other coffee in the city means that a customer has a reasonable expectation for coffee at any given restaurant to be in a similar range of temperature.  By exceeding that range, McDonald's was giving the customer that had a significantly increased risk of injury associated with it without any warning that theirs was different from similar products in other places.",

        "title": "CMV: He, she, they. That's all the pronouns you are getting.",
        "text": "My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is \"xe/xer/xerself\" or \"zi/zis/zimself\". My argument is as follows:\n\n1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A \"he\" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.\n2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.\n3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. \n4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "You can't use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior.  Especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable.  If a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries.  While they might not be able to stop you, they certainly don't need to like or accept the behavior in a social context.  One way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as \"creeping\" and those doing it as being a \"creeper\".\n\nSo another way to word your question is:  \"Do people have a right to be upset that I learned things about them I found they posted online?\"  I say yes, why?  Because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. \n\nFirst I much address:\n\n \"presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.\"\n\nYou presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it.  It might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either.\n\nIf I go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my Mother dying of cancer, it's not a secret conversation and people may over hear.  However if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with \"I heard you talking about your dying Mom at Starbucks last April.\"  I'm going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep.  \n\nThe online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside.  If someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in Photoshop later.  While legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules.  These rules can change from group to group and you don't have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with  idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online.  They may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly don't need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction.",

It's going to be about my own crude understanding of modern neuroscience. \n\nThe part you're missing in the above description is that romantic love also has two other key components in most tests, which I'll call **prioritization** and **interconnection**.\n\nI'll start with the latter because it's harder to catch, but easier to visualize: **Interconnection** is how much your thoughts about X are connected to other thoughts. In simplified terms, whenever you think of \"Ice Cream\", your neurons will also send signals to other nearby concepts, such as the taste associated with ice cream, memories related to ice cream, images, coldness, and so on, and this propagates through a network of concepts and memories in your brain. \n\nWith a normal person that you spend a lot of time with, that \"person\" in your mind is actually a lot of different concepts and nodes that connect to a lot of other things, and their name and face are only small parts of that. When you think about that girl Lorraine the Model, you're more likely to trigger the neurons in your brain related to the color pink because you know she likes pink, and she often wears it, so the connections between the nodes that contain your mental model of Lorraine are more closely connected with the nodes that fire off when you think of the color pink, than if you were to think about George the Office Guy. \n\nWith someone that you're starting to get romantically attracted to, beyond the simple physical lust/attraction, it's frequently observed that you'll also start... \"enlarging\" the network of connections from that person-concept to other concepts and memories in your brain, so that \"they\" connect to more things in your mind... and more other things in your mind connect to \"them\". \n\nTo visualize this, look at [this graph here](http://nickpegg.com/media/img/more_fun_with_graphs/nys-super-sanitized.png) and imagine this graph represents concepts in your mind. Green are clear concepts (\"walking\", \"ice cream\", etc.), beige are specific memory data, and yellow are persons. Naturally this image isn't actually about neurons in brains, but it serves for this illustration. Notice the one yellow node that is so much more connected than the other yellow nodes? How it has many more memory/experience connections, but also due to its larger share of space is connected to more green concepts as well? \n\nThat's the person you're getting romantically attracted to. \n\n**Prioritization** is simpler. It's when some concept in your mind has more affect associated with it, and thus holds higher *value*. It's frequently observed in tests that subjects will pay a higher cost to protect their SO / subject of romantic love than would be explained by the simple combination of platonic relationship and physical attraction. It's also harder to visualize, because it's not a linear number that you can just add up... letting that person cry for a few hours alone is still less negatively valued than letting your brother die, for instance. However, to take the graph analogy above, when a moral or hedonistic calculation goes through the nodes for this person, the resulting choice will weigh more heavily in that direction if the subject was one you were romantically attracted to than if the subject were only someone you were lusting for and had a platonic relationship with. \n\nIn other words, it also depends on how much space they occupy in your mental map (measured by how often thinking about something else makes you also think about them) and how much emotion is generated when they are involved (measured by how long you spend crying if they tell you you're stupid vs someone else tells you you're stupid... or preferably some other, less painful method). Not just how much you interact with them, how much you trust them or how much you want to fuck them. ",

        "text": "I just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing\". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.\n\nSometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.\n\nThus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**\n\nI will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:\n\n* \"They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" \n\nYes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\n* \"The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.\"\n\nBut to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\n* \"It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.\"\n\nSuck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, \"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nOkay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!\n\n**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments.

        "argument": "You answered your own debate... *\"Suck it up, if you want to learn history, watch a documentary.*\n\nBut to address some of your points: If you want to see a \"proper film\" about Pearl Harbor, watch *Tora! Tora! Tora!*. That movie is so factually correct that the 'historical accuracy' debates are mostly about the obvious bits (American carriers had to pretend to be Japanese ones, since the Japanese ones were on the bottom of the ocean), and some less obvious bits about which particular sub-model of aircraft was (or sometimes should have been) used as the basis for mocked up models used in the film. (That's why Michael Bay felt the need to go so far beyond the actual facts, he was trying to separate his film from the others, mainly from this one.)\n\nBut what happens in a case like this? You have a movie that's based on a true story, uses two different books as its foundation, was made with countless technical advisors, the stories of numerous American and Japanese battle participants, the full cooperation of the military to collaborate on complex (and massive) ship and aircraft movements... the works... and they still made mistakes. At what point is a production designer saying \"This engine cowling looks cooler\" different from a scriptwriter saying \"This battle seems cooler\"? And what about information that remained classified in 1970 that's come to light since? Should we retroactively ban films?\n\nWhat happens when it's something like *Braveheart*, where certain facts are (and will remain forever) unknown? Is that story simply off-limits for all time (or until we build a time machine)?\n\n\"Based on a true story\" does not mean (and has never meant) historical accuracy. It means \"We didn't come up with the basis for this story, and we've paid someone for the rights to use *their* story as the basis for our film instead\". Notice the difference in the disclaimers at the beginning of most films ('Based on a true story' flashing onscreen for a few seconds) compared to *Tora! Tora! Tora!* (which takes like 3 minutes to go over their attempts at accuracy).\n\nI think the larger failing in your primary example isn't that \"historical fiction\" about the Cold War was used as the basis for your History class, it's that education should be less about dumping information into student's heads, and more about teaching them to acquire and critically evaluate the information they do receive.",

Transgender people don't want to be lumped in with other people with mental illnesses because there is a such a stigma against it.

        "argument": "&gt; I do not see how this follows. Does this not give more credence to the idea that it is a mental disorder?\n\nThey're not different from the general population. They're aligned with those of the sex with which the trans people in question identify. The brain of a trans man is no more disordered than that of a cis man, because they're similarly structured.\n\n&gt; if you feel you need surgery or hormone therapy because of what you are thinking, is that not the definition of a disorder?\n\nNo. Here is the DSM-4's introduction to the subject (I would use 5 but do not have the text on hand; I would not expect it is much different):\n\n&gt;&gt; ...although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders, it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of ‘mental disorder.’ The concept of mental disorder, like many other concepts in medicine and science, lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations...Despite these caveats, the definition of mental disorder that was included in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is presented here because it is as useful as any other available definition and has helped to guide decisions regarding which conditions on the boundary between normality and pathology should be included in DSM-IV. In DSM-IV, each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom. In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.\n\nWe can summarize this more succinctly as that a mental disorder must:\n\n* Be a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual.\n* Be associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.\n* Not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one.\n* Be a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual.\n* Not simply be deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor simply a conflicts primarily between the individual and society unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual.\n\nThe first and fourth criteria boil down to \"it's a recognizable thing that is bad\", so it's the second, third, and fifth that matter.\n\nCis people show the same distress as trans people do when their gender identities are denied to them. See again the Reimer and Vincent cases, as well as more mild situations like men with gynecomastia or women who need a mastectomy (who are usually quite distressed). This distress is absolutely expectable, and in the case of cis people no one seriously disputes this. The distress in trans people is identical, and thus trans people do not meet the third criterion.\n\nMoreover, a post-transition trans person who has had good results from transition (which most would, in a world where people aren't overwhelmingly pressured to bury their feelings into middle-age) does not experience present distress or disability as a result of being trans. In other words, their dysphoria has been permanently treated *on a physical level*, without changing the way they think or behave or directly targeting their brain or mental state. Therefore, once dysphoria has been medically (and NOT psychiatrically!) cured, trans people no longer meet the second criterion either.\n\nMoreover, the vast majority of the distress trans people feel is related to non-acceptance. Our much-touted high suicide rates dwindle when we're accepted as who and what we are without judgment or attack. Merely having an accepting family halves the suicide attempt rate among trans folk; virtually all regrets are rooted in sufficiently poor results from transition that one deals with nearly constant harassment. It follows that the majority of the dysfunction is related to a conflict between the individual and society, so trans people largely fail to meet the fifth criterion either.\n\nIf we take your argument, someone taking Tylenol when they have a headache is mentally disordered, because they want to modify their body as a result of how they're feeling.",

Normally I don't support vigilante justice, but at this point, Batman is obviously the only person who can stop the Joker. Additionally, it is obvious that Arkham cannot hold him. He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). \n\nOstensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak).\n\nHere are my main views\n\n1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him\n\n2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it.\n\n3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms.\n\n**Important Points** \n\n* The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions.\n\n* Batman is **not** equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman. All I am saying is that he bares some level of responsibility for his refusal to stop the Joker.\n\n* Finally, Batman is not responsible for the people that the Joker killed early on in his career before it became apparent that he could not be contained. \n\n**Edit**\n\n* If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possibly come to an agreement\n\n* The only criminal that I am applying this argument to is the Joker.

There is a wide gulf of stuff Batman could do between \"kill joker\" and \"leave Joker to the authorities\".\n\nAlternatively, Batman could use his considerable wealth to figure out how to get Joker tried in a state or nation that does execute its prisoners.

I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.\n\nThe reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that \"love is love\" and \"loving who you choose is your right\". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.\n\nNow I won't delve into the typical response of \"Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!\" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what \"marriage\" is.\n\nI believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of \"love is love\" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of \"marriage\" to include anything we want it to under the law.\n\n~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this \"relationship\"~~.\n\nBut then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history.

I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future.

        "argument": "&gt;I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of \"love is love\" will still apply.\n\nI think this is unlikely, simply because polygamy is not a one-size-fits-all arrangement. Even if polyamorous individuals want their three, four, or five-person relationships acknowledged under the law, there's more obstacles than just legal recognition—the first obstacle, and probably the biggest obstacle to polyamorous relationships in the first place, is negotiating the terms of the relationship.\n\nMarriage is a lot of pair-exclusive privileges, rights, commitments, and responsibilities. Larger benefits from certain benefits programs if married. Sponsorship of a spouse for immigration purposes. Parenting rights. Treating held property as shared. Declaring next-of-kin for survivor benefits, emergency medical decisions, and wrongful death lawsuits. Spousal Privilege. Child support. And the list goes on and on and on.\n\nEach one of those needs to be worked out in a polyamorous relationship, determined individually and often contentiously in the long-term. Unless, of course, the polyamorous relationship is using the relatively common model of \"a primary-partnership pair, alongside other groups of primary-partnership pairings and individuals, existing within a family-like community,\" in which case marriage as it exists post-Obergefell v. Hodges is sufficient to assign those rights and privileges effectively—effectively, sufficient to recognize their relationships.\n\nSimply put, there's not going to be a push for legalization of polygamy because there's not enough of an agreement on what polygamy is. It's either too different from marriage for enough people to agree on it as a one-size-fits-all institution, or too similar to marriage (and accessible enough to the individuals in question) that there's no need to ask for a change.\n\nAt most, there might be a push to allow for assignment of those rights and privileges to different people under contract law.

I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. \n\nThe reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's \"prey\" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. \n\nWhenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women.\n\nI guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. \n\nI really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone.

Or that a woman could penetratively rape a man with some device?\n\n&gt; I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory\n\nWho do you think is more injured, a scrawny 18 year old male getting anally raped by a man, or a kickboxing champion 30 year female getting anally raped by a man?

        "text": "I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. \n\nHowever, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.\n\nBUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. \n\nA metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. \n\nAs a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nApologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.\n\nThanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. \n\nSpain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my \"one family name\" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. \n\nWhat I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. \n\nI also want to clarify: My problem with the \"mouthful\" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. \n\nFinally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: \n\n&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.\n\n&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.\n\nMy American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. \n\nWhile I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.\n\nThanks guys!",
        "argument": "I think it's useful to be able to identify a family on the basis of last names, and so I think it's useful for everyone to share the same label.\n\nAnd this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name \"Montegue-Capulet\" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.\n\nOf course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).\n\nIn summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating. I figure we may as well adopt that system as efficiently and informatively as possible.",

        "title": "CMV: 'Mouse and keyboard' is the superior control scheme for PC gaming.",
        "text": "I am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. \n\nWhy I want my view changed:\n\n* I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use.\n\n* Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? \n\n* I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. \n\nEdit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience.\n\nEdit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by /u/stoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase. Thanks, everyone, this was exactly the conversation I wanted to have. Please feel free to keep posting, if you have something new to add. I will keep reading, commenting, and awarding deltas. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In real life, drivers learn just as much from the feel of the car as they do from what they see and hear.The controller technology is getting more advanced with every new iteration.\n\n&gt;&gt; As you drive, you’ll feel undulations in road surface, changes in tire friction, and rolling over things like rumble strips and the like.

People working 80+ hours a week on multiple jobs often don't have the time to do all this prep work.  \n\nYou also ignored my point about food deserts. For some families it is very hard to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Imagine trying to feed a family on gas station food. That is a reality for a lot more people than I think you realize. \n\nAnd again, some people simply don't have the knowledge, or intellect to eat a healthy vegan diet. You have to pay attention to what you eat to make sure you are getting all of your amino acids.

        "text": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:\n\n1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.\n\n2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.\n\n3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...\n\n4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.\n\nWhat would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.\n\nEdit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it \"should have\" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.\n\nEdit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.\n\nEdit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table.",
        "argument": "So I do think this policy I justified, but I don't think it's a good mechanism for mandatory vaccination.\n\nThe people who insist on not vaccinating their children do so because they think it would be harmful for their child, and some of them probably hold this belief strong enough so that they would not enroll their children in school. Are anti-vaxxers really the people you want homeschooling children? The comparison here is, with mandatory vaccinations, hundreds of kids have their lives ruined by leaving school each year. Without them, maybe once every decade, less than a hundred kids will get sick for a few weeks. \n\nBut the problem is also worse than that, because this also plays into a lot of anti-vaxxer rhetoric. A lot of it relies on exploiting people's fears of the government. Mandatory vaccines only make that seem worse. Additionally, it makes these people even less trusting of the government, meaning that they are more likely to shut themselves of from outside streams of information. So it forces many anti-vaxxers into even more of an echo chamber. One of the must successful ways to spread information is to have anti-vaxxers have a friend or a neighbor who can discuss these things with them. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is by forcing them further away from the rest of society.",

        "title": "CMV: I am over 10 years out of college and have a great career. I have a hard time accepting that a driven, intelligent person would fail in finding success.",
        "text": "This is not meant to be a troll post, but an earnest attempt to determine if my views are incorrect or unfair.  I have two minds when it comes to the fact that so many people have trouble finding a job that pays a living wage and is something they enjoy.  On one hand I am very sympathetic and feel that I have been lucky in life to get to where I am.  On the other hand I got to where I am through taking calculated risks and then stacking the deck in my favor.  There was definitely luck involved, but not all the risks I took paid out and I had to move on to something else.  I feel like too many people aren't taking matters into their own hands regarding their own success, like I feel I did, and I simultaneously feel proud and callous in that belief.  I am unsure which one is more correct.\n\nExample #1\n\nI have been on the recruiting side of multiple companies (tech sector) and have been blown away by the low quality/behavior of applicants.  These are the people that get through the resume filter and are invited on site.  Now I never test applicants on specific details of systems, because in practice you look those up as needed on the job.  I asked about what they have done in the past or what parts of their training they were most familiar with and tested their understanding of it.  I have had people that came into interviews and tried to act like they were running the show, people who refused to answer questions I asked, and people not familiar with the most basic parts of what they said they were experts in.  I know this is anecdotal, but the fact that it was so difficult to find people that were remotely qualified in fields they had spent years studying completely confused me.  The bar for applicants was not high in most cases my team was very motivated to find someone to hire.  I could not understand why people seemed to put in so little effort to sell themselves.\n \nExample #2\n\nI once worked for many years at a company that was funded off of venture capital around '08, where all investors closed up shop.  There was a lot of pressure on the company and there were multiple mass layoffs that cut staff to the bone and then even further.  I survived all of them, and eventually resigned because I correctly predicted the company would fold in a month.  I was fully aware of the risk of me losing my job and I countered that by simply being very useful.  This was a win-win scenario, because I was an enthusiastic employee and was happy to improve my skills through working on any existing part of the system or try to develop new ones.  Because of this I was more valuable than most of the other employees and had a ton of work/learning experiences I could talk about with recruiters.  Anyone on the team that was remotely difficult to deal with got cut, and I saw their downfall much earlier than it happened.  Now if everyone is being the star employee it would be a different but I have never found a group where that is the case.  For any individual on a team, you don't have to work more hours than someone else to be more valuable than them; you just need to be more friendly, cooperative, and effective.  In my experience that just requires effort and not any special creativity.\n\nExample #3\n\nI started off with a lot of bad habits that inhibited my professional development.  I am very stubborn, so I tend to go down the wrong path for quite a while before I accept that it is wrong.  Despite that, I always honestly evaluated why other people were more effective employees/professionals than me.  In those cases, I would take a step back, forget my ego, and ask myself what they were doing that I was not.  I'd talk to close friends about this to analyze my conclusions and when I figured out what they were doing better I would work incorporate that into myself.  It seemed much easier to mimic the habits of successful people rather than come up with the behaviors on my own.  The fact that I don't see a lot of people doing this completely baffles me.\n\nMy experience has been limited to the tech sector but I don't see why this wouldn't generalize to other fields.  Now there are certainly fields where the supply of people overtakes the demand, but I were in that position I would give it my best shot and if it didn't work out I'd move on to something else.  Please tell me if I'm wrong.\n\nedit: from a lot of the comments, I would like to clarify that I did not mean immediate success.  Rather, that one can be driven and follow a path that eventually does not pan out, but that being drive will eventually lead one to success.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "&gt;However, dreams must be put in realistic terms.\n\nI definitely agree with this. I think someone who is interested in philosophy should try to become a professor, rather than hoping to get a job with a bachelor's degree. Yet, unfortunately, the rhetoric in our society is \"do your dreams, it'll all work out!\" And many college graduates never got to here the advice that dreams should be tempered with realism. That's one reason why *48% of college grads* aren't in jobs that use their degrees. Sure this problem is mostly isolated to the people who were misinformed-- *but that doesn't mean it isn't a problem, especially when there are so many people who fell victim to this misinformation*.\n\nAnd one thing that I think a lot of people overlook-- just how hard it is to predict the future. [Here](http://www.cnbc.com/id/39541097/page/1) is a list of 9 jobs that could belong to bachelor's degree holders, yet, because of the changing economy, are rapidly disappearing. You graduated 10 years ago-- 15 years ago, when you were thinking about your major, could you have predicted everything that changed by now? Of course not! You were basing your decision off of what you knew at the time. Likewise, many people pick jobs that later are made obsolete. It isn't their own fault-- it just happens. But that doesn't mean it isn't a problem.\n\n&gt;I feel like there are many paths to success, and not all of them involve chasing your dream directly. Learning life skills through pursuing a career in one field can give you the ability and the capital to succeed in another field later on. What I hate is the idea of wasted potential, where people pursue very limited opportunities unsuccessfully for long periods and waste opportunities for growth in other ways. There are stigmas to getting a job outside of one's dream path, but having money and learning skills for success can create a foundation later on if the initial attempts at one's dream do not work out.\n\nI agree with this as well, but with one caveat-- if someone has already gone through college, and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, done piles of work, to get a degree in their dream field, it is devestating to them to have to become, say, a barista. I hate how Americans discredit and look down upon jobs that don't require bachelor's degrees, but if you've put in that money, and that time, you expect to get a well paying job that utilizes the degree you have. And if you don't, it is beyond disappointing.",

I personally could empathize more, but perhaps it's not just the days but also considering the age of someone as they're getting out, how much of their lives was taken, and how different a person they might be.*\nInspired a little bit from responding to [this post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/37131i/cmv_when_captured_and_convicted_swat_pranksters/), I think as a society we should really start thinking of imprisonment and announcing sentences in terms of days, not years. In terms of using sentences as a means of discouraging crime, the number 5 sounds small, but 5 years is actually 1826 days (including a leap year), which is a massive number. When you start talking about locking someone away for decades, and you realize actually the thousands and thousands of days you're taking away from person, and if that punishment really does match the severity of the crime... I don't think people actually have the capacity to imagine being sat in a small barred room day after day for that long. They just hear 7 years and think \"Oh it's only 7\", and fail to recognize just how much of someone's life is actually being taken away. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "You are right, I did kind of take a detour from my original argument. I will combine the two. For many people (not everyone) large numbers will be too big to have meaning and small numbers are easier for people to wrap their heads around. If I told you how hot it was in kelvin, the number would be very large but it wouldn't mean anything to you. You would instantly convert it to Celsius or Fahrenheit. Hearing numbers too large to be comprehended isn't better than having numbers that people can comprehend as tiny. Those large numbers don't have ever so slightly more meaning than the largest comprehensible number, to many they have less meaning. Stalin (who I think was a terrible person for the record) said (although I just discovered this quote is likely wrongly attributed to him), \"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.\" I personally believe this quote is true. I can imagine one death, empathize with one death, I can feel as if I have lost a loved one. If I hear of a million deaths I cannot make myself feel grief. I don't have that many loved ones to lose. My inability to grasp the magnitude of that pain actually makes me feel less empathetic pain than I would have if I was only being informed of one death. Sometimes smaller numbers can have a bigger impact. \n\nSorry for long response.\n\nEdit* added wrongly because misatribbuted isn't recognized",

        "text": "The distinction between morality of abortion and its legality is often missed when discussing the pro-life and pro-choice positions. Granted, there’s usually someone that brings it up somewhere down the line, but it is often well after substantial ambiguous conversation. For the purpose of this CMV, I will grant that a fetus is a human person. \nMy views:\n\n1.\tAbortion may or may not be morally permissible, though I lean towards permissible. I don’t really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it’s here for some background on my position.\n\n2.\tAbortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother’s legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus’ (or child’s) right to use them.\n\nOne of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I’d prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I’ve heard is as follows:\n\n\nLet’s say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can’t be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9+ months to a fetus to keep it alive.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThere are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first:\n\n/u/garnteller:\n&gt;So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it?\n\nMy realization as I thought through the implications:\n&gt;This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario:\n\n\n&gt;In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters.\n\n\n&gt;Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen.\n\n\n&gt;So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time.\nThis seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body.\nI guess if a fetus really is a person, it probably should be illegal to abort it.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That said, I think he was dead on.\n\nI think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things.

Modern threats are a good deal less complicated.\n\nTake Vietnam^. The military tried their standard kill-people-break-stuff routine. In fact, they did it way better than they've ever done it before. How'd that go? Did it mitigate the supposed threat from the NVA? Nup.\n\nAnd most modern tasks for the defence force are like that. Aside from China, which is deterred by MAD, all of America's threats, from Al Qaeda to African civil war, are unconventional. That means the US military needs to adopt a more sophisticated approach than Mike Huckabee is capable of understanding with his pea brain. This might be something like counter-insurgency, perhaps. These would involve much more than mere violence. EG, in Afghanistan the strategy is clear and build - political science is just as important as violence!\n\nThis is why people make fun of Mike Huckabee: he's too stupid or dishonest to be capable of understanding complex things like basic strategy.\n\n*The military can also be used for a bunch of other things, like invading and toppling democracies as a welfare handout to American big business.\n\n^Whether or not Vietnam was a real threat is immaterial. That's a decision for the politicians.",

        "text": "This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.\n\nMy understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.\n\nOnce recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.\n\nFrom that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what’s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.\n\nAt this point, I see five possibilities:\n\n1.\tKeynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. \n2.\tKeynesian economics is *co-opted* by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It’s perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. *How* we spend and tax isn’t the issue, just that we do.\n3.\tI have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to “shake up the system” and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?\n4.\tI have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. \n5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.\n\nRight now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I’d really like to understand this theory better.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You are partly-correct, but missing some key information. Keynesian economics is highly focused on unemployment, and during a recession unemployment does hit the working class very severely. Due to job loss, demand for goods and services declines and the profits of the \"capitalist\" manufacturers decline as well. Fiscal policy treats both as *vital* - it really isn't the case that one is more important than the other. Those who say so are talking politics. In economics, both supply and demand are essential. And Keynesian economics addresses this very directly.\n\nI should add that every sensible economist would recommend a mix of Keynesian and monetarist policies. The battle b/w them is politics.

I understand that this is a touchy topic so I'm sorry if what I'm saying comes off as offensive. That is not my intention. My main reasoning is basically this.\nHuman life is incredibly valuable. It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights. As such the maximization of life should take precedence to other considerations, such as the right to choose whether or not you want to terminate a pregnancy. 80% or more of all pregnancies in the united states will be successful, and pursuing an abortion just decreases the amount of possible lives.\n\nTo clarify my point here is a thought experiment. Say you have a 2 year old child and a woman who is pregnant. no one would argue that killing the 2 year old is wrong. No matter how humanely it happens, you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.\n\nAlso, the woman giving birth wouldn't have to take care of the child. contrary to popular belief, in recent years the number of children being put up for adoption has [steadily been decreasing,](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/us-adoption-domestic-waits-idUSBRE90E15Y20130115) while the time it takes for those who want to adopt a child has steadily been increasing, with some couples waiting up to seven years.\n\nAs a note my stance here has nothing to do with any sort of spiritual beliefs. Also I'm left leaning on most issues so it has nothing to do with party alliances. please CMV!\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You can't hold the argument that human holds importance over anything else and then make an exception in the same paragraph. \n\nFurthermore, it seems like in society we ascribe rights to conscious beings, rather then those that are just alive. For example, it is legal to terminate a life of a brain dead patient? It seems to make more sense to determine rights base on agency. A fetus is just a clump of cells, it doesn't think, have memories, or an identity.

It seems simple and uncontroversial enough, but I think it opens the door to nastier stuff. Like, \"Because the BLM protesters are bad, their opinions are invalid,\" or, \"Because the BLM protesters are bad, my opinions are better,\" (because presumably if you're making these moral judgements, you aren't bad) or \"Because the BLM protesters are bad, they deserve bad things to happen to them.\" Those sorts of extensions can be really harmful, especially the last one since it often validates harassment or bullying, yet they often walk hand with moral judgements of character, regardless if they're called for or not.

If I start jogging once a week, I probably won't lose weight, but I'll be a teeny-tiny bit healthier and that's good. \n\nSecondly, BMI is an overall population indicator. There are of course given people who are overweight who are healthier than given people who are within normal range. Same goes for given people who are underweight vs people in normal range. However, I would state that *in general*, the further you slide on the scale from 22.5 in either direction, the further you're getting from optimal.\n\nHowever, wherever people lie on that scale - underweight -&gt; optimal -&gt; fat is none of your fucking business whatsoever.\n\nYou are not a stakeholder in a stranger's health and people would do well to keep their mouths shut about other people's appearance.

Elderly will not be able to get social security and many problems will occur. Aside from countries which have a serious overpopulation issue, such as china. I don't really think my view is going to change here, since it's pretty scientifically backed. Countries like Japan have a serious issue mostly due to lack of children.\n\nMy other view, is something I'd be happy to change.  \nChildren are bad for the individual because of many reasons. First and foremost, they cost way too much. Even if you maintain a relatively frugal lifestyle, two kids will cost you as a much the house you live in (Just throwing numbers around, I know it's not the same across all household incomes). It's also too much of a commitment. This is literally the only thing in life to which a person would commit 18 years or more, that's a quarter of your life. It's constant work, and constant worry. Sure, there are good moments, especially when the kids pass a certain age and you don't have to work 24/7 to keep them from killing themselves.\nI know several people that have lost their children to accidents, war,drugs, etc. and their lives were destroyed. I think the potential for such great tragedy greatly outweighs any potential happiness that may arise from children. This may be an extremely pessimistic view, but to put it in perspective, would you bet your entire life savings along with everything you will ever make in the future in a place where it may yield 20%, or completely lose everything? I wouldn't. I'd not risk my future for any kind of returns.\n\nI'd really like my view changed. I like kids, well, some kids. But I believe my SO and I will be very good parents, and that we'll raise wonderful children. But I just can't imagine it being worth it. For reference, we're both ~30, lower middle class income, currently make around $60k a year.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Many consider it a restriction of free speech and ideas. But why do people get upset with the censorship of books, and not movies or video games?\nIf you are under the age of 17, you are not allowed to see a rated “R” movie without a parent. But you are allowed to go to a bookstore and buy any book you want, no matter how controversial the subject matter. Why is it okay to censor movies and not books? Like books, movies contain ideas, messages, and provoke thought and conversation. I have seen movies that have changed my way of thinking. Most of those movies are rated “R”. How is it fair to restrict teenagers from experiencing the stories and ideas of this particular medium, while allowing those same stories and ideas through literature?\n\nThe same thing goes for video games. There are video games that have been banned from western countries because of content. Oftentimes, game developers have been forced to edit the content in games (depict less blood or sexuality) in order to legally sell their product in a country. This is censorship, plain and simple. They are banning art and ideas because they are controversial and make people uncomfortable. Could you imagine what would happen if we did this with books? Banned them unless the author edited, rewrote, or removed certain scenes? There would be an uproar.\n\nHere is a list of some video games that have either been censored or banned in certain countries:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games[1]\n\nSome people might argue that we are stricter with movies and video games because you can actually see the violence rather than just reading about it. But I don’t really buy this argument. In high school, I had to read “The Sorrow of War” by Bao Ninh. For those of you who haven’t read it, the book is extremely graphic and violent. There were vivid descriptions of people stabling and shooting each other in the face, tanks running over and crushing bodies, and torture. One of the main characters is raped in graphic detail. Profanities, including words like “Fuck” “Shit” and “Cunt” are everywhere. The fact that a 16 year old is allowed and encouraged to read this book, while at the same time banned from watching 22 Jump Street in theaters alone (a movie that is rated R solely because of the language”), is baffling.\n\nTo be clear, I do not agree with regulation and censorship at all. But since we enforce it on games and movies, I think that books should be held to the same standard. CMV.",
        "argument": "&gt;I couldn't find any info in a quick Google search about it being illegal to sell erotica to kids, so if you could find a source, that may potentially change part of my view.\n\n\nUpon reflection I think you may be right about this; I was thinking of laws which prevent the sale of pornographic *images* to children (including magazines) vs. erotica.  I can't find any definitive sources one way or the other but it does seem like it is technically legal.  But (as I will explain further below) partly that is probably because there just isn't much demand for written erotica on the part of teenagers or kids.\n\n\nWith regard to your second point, I do see what you are saying about the default state being different, but I'm not sure how much difference it makes in practical terms.  Where do kids get most of their books?  They may go to bookstores occasionally, but by and large they are getting them from their schools and libraries, which do have pre-emptive content-based censorship.  Even if they go to a bookstore, the average teenager is not necessarily eager to buy risque books in the same way they might be to see risque movies or video games.  My guess is that if somehow emerged a widespread phenomenon of 15-year-olds buying hardcore erotica or whatever, there probably would be some sort of moral panic that would result in stricter content regulations.\n\n\n&gt;Except, some video games have been banned from western countries entirely, so they are taking that choice away from everyone, including adults.\n\nBanning a video game entirely in the U.S. would be a rather blatant First Amendment violation.  Can you give examples of what \"Western countries\" have done this?  I know there are some special situations surrounding, for example, censoring games that promote the Holocaust in Germany.  But as far as I know that type of censorship would apply to books as well as video games.",

        "text": "To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in their personal life based on this kind of statistic? For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy: low skill job and doing things yourself means you won't be buying blueberries from other people. Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market.\n\nOne could do that, yes, but I find it laughable how this is the priority goal for politicians - not health, literacy, justice, equality or some other virtue. When asked why economy should grow, they give contrived reasoning from dynamics of economy. They ignore that economy seems to work in cyclic process of growth and decline. Tragicomically many are ready to *worsen* living conditions of masses to accelerate economic growth. What is the point in all this? How can someone strongly support economic growth while having no interest in either means or results of it?",
        "argument": "Growth is certainly important, especially when populations are growing. As the population goes up, there are more people buying things, so the economy grows.\n\nYour arguments do generally suggest an incomplete understanding of economic theory. Throwing away your old devices the moment a new one comes out isn't actually going to give better growth, since you would otherwise spend that money on something else. Same goes for you food argument. As far as the economy is concerned branded processed food isn't somehow superior to organic \"natural\" food, if anything organic food is better due to the inflated price.\n\nAs for your blueberry picker, indeed living a self sufficient life does not add to GDP. Living a self sufficient life is also inefficient, I strongly advise you to read about the concept of economies of scale.\n\nIts not a meaningless statistic because people don't buy things unless they want or need them, and a growth in GDP implies that more people are getting more of the stuff they want. Politicians want the economy to grow for two reasons. Firstly a bigger economy means more tax revenue, so the government has more money for public services. Secondly people generally live longer and are happier when GDP is high and there is strong growth, because they can easily get the stuff that they want.",

A human killing killing another human is considered unethical.\n2. An alien killing a human is also unethical.\n3. Plants are okay to be eaten because they are not conscious, and cannot feel pain or pleasure.\n4. Basic animals are conscious, and can feel pain or pleasure\n\n**My Logic:**\n\nIf we can agree on my second assumption, then we have to accept that any code of ethics we follow cannot, without purpose, isolate rights to a single tier. So the question now becomes, If meat is not murder, then for what purpose should basic animals not be given the same right to life that a human is given? If we can agree on my third and fourth assumption then I see no reason why a basic animal should not be given the same rights to life as a human.\n\n**What Will Change My View:**\n\nDisproving one of my assumptions in a way that disproves my logic\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.\n\nI'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.\n\nI also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.\n\nAs of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.\n\nI'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as \"vegan\" as possible in the future (I hate this whole \"vegan\" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.\n\nI know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.\n\nOn the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...\n\nFor me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.\n\nI still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.\n\n**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**\n\n&gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.\n\nI have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.\n\n**Another great argument with links**\n\n&gt; In short, the reality is: It adds up.  \n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)  \n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  \nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.  \nIn other words, they ask questions like, \"What are the odds that your purchase of, say, a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys?

        "argument": "I agree with /u/huadpe that simply the act of being vegetarian/vegan makes it easier for other people to reduce their meat consumption, because as the population of vegetarians and vegans expands, restaurants are offering more and better vegetarian/vegan options, including some that are so tasty only the most rabid carnivores would turn their nose up at them. The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.\n\nHelping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)",

To walk away is a terrible thing to do, you have a gun, why wouldn't you use it to protect that poor woman? You are the only one who can! I think we can all agree that when you are in a position of power, you should use your power to fight for the greater good. It is our responsibility to be \"world police\" because we can.\n\nEdit: You guys have some very good points, let me revise my opinion. I was obviously wrong to say that we should get involved in \"all conflicts.\"  We should help people's and nations that need our help, and need us to assist them in an unfortunate situation. For example, if a brutal dictator launches an unprovoked attack on a weaker nation, we should help the weaker nation. If a rebel group is fighting a brutal dictator and trying to establish a democracy, we should help establish a democracy. \n\nLets say 2 countries both depend on a certain river for water, and the up stream nation takes all the water before it reaches its downstream neighbor. So the down steam neighbor, after trying to negotiate, resorts to warfare, and attacks its upstream neighbor. We should get involved, but not necessarily with force. We should start negotiations to get them to share the water. Or we could help the downstream neighbor develop a new source of water. The point is, we don't necessarily have to use force to solve the conflict. But if the upstream nation absolutely refused to allow the downstream nation any water, than we may have to threaten them with force, and if that doesn't work, then we could use force.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Society and sound government requires taxes and I think it's absolutely fair to have taxes on income, sales, purchases, whatever. But for government to come in when a dying person passes on their belongings or money to someone they care about and snatch away a piece of it is a step too far.\n\nI am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax. However since Spain is in recession it is extremely difficult to sell the house, and some people are forced to forfeit the property in order to be aligned with the law. This is not the basis of my belief, but it is what motivated me to post this to CMV.\n\nI want someone to give me a good reason to CMV since I think taxes are overall a positive thing. This is just one instance I think is outrageous.\n\n**TL; DR** I understand the need for and support taxation but I cannot support government interference in a dying person's gift to another person. CMV!\n\nEDIT: A few people are bringing up the situation in the US, where inheritance tax doesn't apply to amounts under 5 and a half million. That's fine. Well done USA. But just because it's adjusted and applied like that in the US doesn't make the concept any more agreeable when used throughout the rest of the world. I am not interested in talking about the US example if your argument is based around \"the US has this special set of circumstances and therefore the tax is ok\".\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax.\n\nYeah I can see how that would be a problem. Particularly for people who do not want to sell their loved ones home, but who also don't have the liquid assets available to pay the tax. \n\nAs far as I know, the inheritance tax (on a federal level) in the USA only kicks in once you bequeath or give a relative an amount over 5 million dollars or so. So basically as long as no one in your will gets more than approx 5 million dollars, they do not have to pay any estate tax. As a result, the estate tax affects a very tiny number of people in the US. \n\nStates have their own estate taxes. Some of which only kick in once the person exceeds the federal limit, and some of which are completely independent of the federal limit.\n\nEssentially, at least in the case of the US, the estate tax only affects people who are quite wealthy, or those who are moderately wealthy but only have one or two living relatives. I'm not sure if this changes your view, but it at least shows that the people who are most affected by such laws are usually the people who are \"hurt\" less by them. ",

        "text": "I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.\n\nMy main points:\n\n1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. \n\n2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) \n\n3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. \n\nThese reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks. \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "OK. I'm going to look specifically at your points in turn.\n\n1) **Physical**. Absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. But a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir](http://espn.go.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/13337513/katrin-tanja-davidsdottir-plays-mental-game-win-crossfit-games), I'm fairly certain she could take most men on and win. To further expand on your point; so what? So women are on average less strong. I'm not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue.\n\n2) **Industry**. I really think your experiences have biased you here. [Oil refining is 18% female](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) (actually higher than I expected). This means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. Some of the issues you've seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. As for the women who aren't good at their work- I wonder, do you notice the men who aren't good at their work too?\n\n3) **At home**. This one's awkward. There are a few different possibilities here and, I'll be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- I hope you don't get too offended. \n\n* First, I noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. You're an engineer- that's your bag. So you notice when your girlfriend isn't good at physical things. But I wonder if you've noticed your own failings? Perhaps she's always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. Maybe you're not very good at art or design. Are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **Possibly, yes**.  But this is not something for which you should be blamed. They aren't part of your skill-set, but you can learn.\n\n* Perhaps you're impatient. When you were looking at the gear system you used your previous knowledge and applied it to the situation at hand. There's no parallel for your girlfriend; it's the same as asking someone who's only ever driven an automatic car to move to a manual. It's possible, but they will kangaroo down the road for a while before they get the hang of it. \n\nI remember that it was only a few years ago that my mum was terrible with computers. She's an intelligent woman, a teacher, but they weren't her thing. Why? Because she was trying to learn from me, my sister or my dad- all of whom would just say \"oh give it here\" when she was struggling. Our impatience meant she didn't learn. She did a 1-week course and came out knowing everything she needed to know because the teacher there has the patience to let her learn.\n\n* Maybe you date stupid or physically inept women. This is possible; I can imagine that if you show this 'women are stupid' belief in the real world, intelligent women may be less likely to want to spend time with you.\n\n--\n\nSo what does this mean? my TL;DR is that I think you're focussing on things at which you are good, measuring some women against these, then using this to judge women as a whole. \n\nWe could talk about how [more women than men graduate college.](http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2012/feb/21/edu-women-overtake-men-in-earning-degrees-at-all/71196/) I could show you that in the [developing world women make up a growing percentage of new entrepreneurs.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/female-entrepreneurship_n_1149393.html)\n\nBut I think the most likely argument I can make is about environment. The men you hang out with are engineers. They are likely to be above average intelligence. Depending on where you meet women, they are more likely to be average. A very good friend of mine is an engineer, working for one of the top companies in the world designing airports. I like to think she'd be able to show you a thing or two!",

Older console RPGs had more of a sense of tension: the awareness that you might be ambushed made dungeons in Dragon Warrior or Phantasy Star feel like very dangerous places, and you felt really accomplished if you managed to clear one out and escape with your life.\n\nAlso, games like Paper Mario and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest can use this sort of visible enemy system because they have no overworlds.  Monsters could be set up in bottlenecks in dungeons, but on the overworld there would be no way to force confrontations since you could walk around any enemy you see.

Watney establishes contact with NASA by driving over to the Sojurner rover and stealing/fixing it to transmit to Earth (which...*awesome*).\n\nA few plans are developed to save him, one involving a hastily built probe to resupply him which blows up on takeoff.  That first one I buy.  But the latter plans I don't.  And I have two principal objections.\n\nFirst, it seems like NASA executives make the calls on these.  This would not be the case.  It would be the President of the United States making the ultimate decision to greenlight projects.  And at that level, it seems very unlikely that they'd get the greenlight.  The independence of NASA in the book is greatly at odds with how I see government agencies working.\n\nThe Chinese government would not give a large booster over to NASA like they did.  This is portrayed as happening at the agency level coordinating with the Chinese space agency and then presenting it to political leaders as a fait accompli.\n\nThe plan is super-risky though, and depends on a single resupply mission with a quickly built supply ship - one of which just blew up on the pad.  If the resupply doesn't work, all 6 astronauts die.  Or 5, if they do space cannibalism.\n\nI just don't think the governments of two countries who don't get along great would coordinate to waste hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (the plan also scrubs Ares 4 by taking its ascent vehicle), all to have a very low chance of rescuing one guy at the substantial risk to 5 more people.  And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me.\n\nMuch more likely is that Watney would have been asked to compose letters to whomever he wanted, perform science til his food ran out (assuming he was willing) and then take a lethal dose of morphine.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Since the money needs to come from the public purse, political will is the main barrier. In 1961, President Kennedy said that man would walk on the moon. With the political willpower in place, it happened, despite the fact that it was incredible expensive - overall the Apollo programme cost around $176bn in adjusted US dollars. Could that money have been spent better on R&amp;D? Maybe, maybe not - but ask any engineer or scientist who was alive at the time, and they'll say that it was 100% worth the cost - it is one of our defining moments in history.\n\nYou can bet your butt that in the book, the dudes in NASA would take every opportunity to promote the benefits of this mission to the politicians in order to ensure that the $$$ flowed. As soon as they saw that Watney's plight had captured the heart of the nation(s), the political will was there - just the same as Kennedy's 1961 mandate - and humanity went ahead with their plans. Look at how the whole world was united in a single purpose. In a way, the story was about mankind back on Earth overcoming barriers and boundaries in order to do something incredible as as whole species - while at the same time, Watney was overcoming his own issues on Mars.\n\nOverall, we learn from failures as well as successes. NASA knows this, and if this had all happened in real life you could be sure that they would have learned a huge amount about living and working on the Mars conditions just through Watney's recounts of his experience - an invaluable amount of data which would have been lost.",

This would be fine if Islam could be reformed. But that's the trouble with Islam. It has not been widely reformed and I'm afraid it cannot be due to its structure. Sure, it has a similar structure\n\nThe concept of Dar-al-harb/Garb/Kufr (War, War(ottoman),Infidel) and the Dar-al-Islam (Islam/Peace) is one that divides the world into two; nations that follow the law of Islam (Shariah) and those that don't. Before you say that this practice is outdated and out of style, please look at Salafis, the extremist groups in the middle east, and [this fine fellow and other people like him that do not classify as salafis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV710c1dgpU). Even if the Quran is not taken literally, Shariah law still applies. I have lived in an Islamic country. You do not need to take the Hadith and Quran literally to be subject to literal Shariah law.\n\nRead here:\n&gt;Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively small role in defining the laws on the country. It only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts has jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states there are sharia criminal laws, for example there is the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 5000, and imprisonment to not more than 3 years. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law\n\nYou can literally go to jail for renouncing Islam. It's far more serious in countries like Saudi Arabia, and 4 in 10 muslims in the UK want to establish Shariah law. In fact, there are 85 shariah law courthouses in the UK which run by court-approval basis. I personally believe that the political stress plus the fact that both parties signed an agreement to be judged by shariah law makes every case a stamp-and-go case. Before you say that both if both parties consent to it, it's alright, please think about the cultural and familial pressure of Islam and their treatment of women.\n\nWe must not forget Islam's borderline slavery of women. They are covered, silenced, veiled, separated, and treated as commodity. God willing, they at least inherit half the amount a man of the same level of descendence would.\n\nI do not say that muslims are bad people and must convert to be part of today's society. I do not say that at all. In fact, I say the opposite. If anything can stop the self-indulgent hedonism of today's society it is Muslims (And Sikhs). I just say that Islam conflicts with today's society, and it cannot be wholly compatible with today's world. I do not approve of Islam. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "Just about every religion is in its purest form, incompatible with modern Western society. However, a lot of religious followers adapt as their culture shifts to the more modern culture. Islam is no exception.\n\nI live on Long Island in New York. There's a huge Muslim population. There's also a huge Jewish population, huge Chrisian population, huge Buddhist population, huge Hindu population...basically, very diverse in religion. And bar none, all of these religions have believers who are on a spectrum from very orthodox/conservative to very liberal/progressive in how they reconcile old faiths with moderns ideas and society.\n\nIt's a microcosm for the world, because at the end of the day, every religion has differences in how they are observed. As an atheist who was raised Jewish, my family was very modern, and view the Torah as a collection of books that were written to help guide Jews back in the days of the old Kingdom of Judea. Some of the stories still give good lessons, but the essence of Judaism wasn't following the laws and rules set forth in the Tanakh, but to live life in a way God would approve. Other Jews who lived in the same neighborhood lived their lives by the letter of Judaic law, keeping kosher, observing the Sabbath, etc.\n\nI've seen that with my Muslim friends. One of them is very strict in following the Quran and the Haddith, only eating halal meat, praying 5 times a day, etc. Most of them are less strict and follow a much looser code of conduct that was basically the same way I was raised. And the same could be said for my Christian friends.\n\nThe problem is that for a lot of people, the only image of Islam they are exposed to isn't the people on Long Island who are harmless, but the people who live in the MENA regions. Their religions might as well be completely different, because the ones who live on Long Island and are raised with Western culture have assimilated their faith with their culture. Those in MENA have done the same, but they aren't assimilating with Western culture but with a harsher culture that is born out of lower socioeconomic standards, a history of cultural oppression, etc.\n\nA better comparison for the MENA Muslims who make headlines is the Christians in sub-Saharan Africa. Culturally they are very similar in many ways (much more orthodox/conservative, fewer women's rights, prevalence of FGM, lack of literacy, etc.).\n\nSo saying Islam isn't compatible with modern (I'll assume you mean Western) society because of Muslims who were born and/or raised in MENA is akin to saying Christianity isn't compatible with modern Western society because of the Christians born and/or raised in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAs for Muslim immigrants to Europe, Australia, and the Americas, they seem to follow the same trends of every single immigration wave: the first generation or two to immigrate will be resistant to assimilation and will be very protective of keeping their cultures, but the generations that are born in the new country are much more of a melting pot. The problem is that the recent wave of Muslim immigrants is so recent that the second generation of Muslim immigrant families hasn't happened yet, and people tend to freak out for no reason. ",

I do make an exception for diets which are unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc… but some diets, such as gluten free or dairy free, do not cause this issue, and the individuals feel great when they do it, whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in person and I don’t really understand why. If the individuals is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect individuals who practice their religions. In both cases I agree that if they shove it in people’s faces and try to convert people they know, it is annoying, but if they keep to themselves and understand that it is not for everyone, I don't see a reason for all the hate on people who follow these lifestyles.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "You're treating life as if its \"value\" were easily quantifiable. \n\n&gt;&gt;\"I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.\"\n\nSo, ruling out the unlikely extremes, we can imagine that the vast majority of them would grow up to be \"regular\" or \"average\" people, correct? \n\nAverage people grow, explore, discover, make friends, they create, they produce, they share, they connect, they bond, they feel and illicit feeling. They have families, they make families, they love and they are loved. Assuming you don't come from a family of exclusively \"geniuses, and great innovators\" or \"Unabombers and sociopaths\", presumably you are, and are surrounded by fairly average people. How do you measure their value? If one were to get incredibly ill, and was unable to pay for the entirety of their care, would you consider them an unwarranted cost on society? Ought they simply be left to die for the greater good? What if it were your young son? \n\nYou have to understand that when discussing matters of life and death, money is not the correct language. The value of human life cannot be measured in dollars. It is measured in emotion, love, connections, influence...\n\nHave you never been impacted by another human being? How can you measure the impact and importance of a kind, positive person. That individual will walk through their life leaving positive impressions and effects all around them - like a wake behind a boat, rippling out and out, influencing the next person and the next, who then turns around and continues that outward spread. Have you never been effected by a warm smile, or a bit of small-talk?\n\nClearly, I disagree with the entire premise of your argument. I think it shows a profound lack of empathy, or better yet, any actual understanding of life and humanity. However, let's go on and debate this on your own terms. \n\nYou say that the cost of caring for these sick kids isn't justified by the potential of their being great successes, simply because the odds of that happening are too slim. \n\n&gt;&gt;\" I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump.\"\n\nYou are right that the odds are slim, however you are wrong to say that therefore \"the argument falls apart when we look at expected returns.\" Let's use your Einstein example. How does one quantify the monetary worth of a great scientist? Let's imagine that we had never had the contributions of Watson &amp; Crick. Without the discovery and understanding of DNA, where would modern medicine stand today? Is caring for 100 thousand \"average\" sick kids worth the preservation of 1 Watson &amp; Crick equivalent? I would certainly say so. \n\nLet's look at a businessman like Steve Jobs. How much wealth did he create in his lifetime? How many billions and billions of dollars were generated in the development, production, distribution and sales of his products? You say, \"he's 1 in a million,\" right? Well, let's imagine he's generated 10 billion dollars of wealth in his lifetime (rather conservative). Him being 1 in a million means that we could spend 1,000 dollars on each and every one of the other 999,000 individuals and we'd only just then reach his worth. Moreover, that's assuming that the other 999,000 people contributed *absolutely zero value over their entire lives*. \n\nThe other problem with your argument is that you seem to believe that great people exist in vacuums. Perhaps the sick kid you save is our next great scientist's little cousin. Perhaps his or her little cousin's perseverance, strength, or tragic death, has motivated and inspired our future scientist to do great things. Perhaps this sick child lives long enough to make friends in school. Perhaps he or she loves science fiction books and movies, and that interest rubs off on one of his/her friends who otherwise wouldn't have picked up this interest at such a young age. Perhaps that nascent interest in the wonders of science and its possibilities was *invaluable* in the formation of our next great scientist. \n\nThe bottom line is, trying to place a dollar amount on the value of a human life is hopeless. We exist in infinitely complex social environments, and even \"average\" people can be instrumental in the generation of massive, valuable changes in the world. \n\nAll that aside, we preserve the lives of ill children (or of any age), because someone loves them. They don't want to lose them. There is no dollar amount one can place on that. ",

        "text": "I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. \n\nHowever, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.\n\nBUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. \n\nA metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. \n\nAs a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nApologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.\n\nThanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. \n\nSpain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my \"one family name\" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. \n\nWhat I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. \n\nI also want to clarify: My problem with the \"mouthful\" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. \n\nFinally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: \n\n&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.\n\n&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.\n\nMy American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. \n\nWhile I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.\n\nThanks guys!",
        "argument": "I think you already know you are rationally incorrect, but you are trying to justify an instinctive preference for the naming system that   \"feels\" right in your gut. The single-last-name-of-father system likely feels most correct to you because it (a) is most familiar and (b) gives you the most benefits while asking the fewest concessions. First, you know that you have an ingrained and biased preference about names: you prefer your wife and children take your name, but would feel uncomfortable or disappointed by the opposite. This is not a topic on which you are neutral and simply trying to find the easiest universal system.\n\nAs a measure of clarity – who is related to whom – hyphenating provides *more* information. The single-last-name system obscures familial relationships in comparison.\n\nAs a measure of legal identity – how many people share your name – hyphenating makes each name more distinct. \n\nI too work in an industry where I deal with thousands of names and families. The single last name system does not allow me to know “who is related to who” at anything better than an educated guess. I know dozens of families who share last names but no close relation. I know dozens of blended families. I know dozens of guardians who don’t share names with children, and committed couples who are not married. I also know siblings who get mistaken for spouses, and spouses who have been mistaken for siblings. Helping strangers make assumptions based on a single last name seems like the weakest possible defense. \n\nAs a matter of personal identity – the right of a couple to determine family identity and choose names that are appropriate, representative, and meaningful – having a range of possibilities means couples can make a decision about how they understand their family construction. Group labeling and identity are incredibly strong sociological forces. \n\nAs a measure of ease – spelling, length – that consideration does not exist in any other naming context, and it becomes absurd to try to impose the ease standard universally. If your wife had a much shorter last name than you, would it be inconsiderate to give your own name to your children? Is it unnecessarily complicated to give children a first name with more than one syllable? Is it unacceptable to name your child after your French mother if the name may be difficult for American businesses? \n\nMaybe more to he point, though, the difference in ease between the most complex and most simple names I have *ever* written has been minor - a dozen letters, a double-check on spelling, a confirmation. Literally a difference of a few seconds. \n\nWhile this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.\n\nI do see nods to individual choice in your post, but only if you never have to interact with a world where people choose differently than you. \n\nWomen should not have to take their husband’s name, but you only want to marry a woman who will. Men should have the option to take their wife’s name, but you'll never consider it. Children can have either parent's name, as long as yours have *only* their father's. Gay couples need ways to build family identity, but only if you don't have to see a hyphenated name.\n\nYou want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. \n\nAlso, as a side-note, it is a pretty well-documented phenomenon that people are less likely to change a position after taking a public stance. You begin by saying you have “had a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names.” If you have expressed “joking” superiority or derision towards people who do not like the same names you like, then you may feel compelled to justify that you were just smarter all along, rather than arbitrarily judgmental or dickish. \n\nEdit: Formatting\n\n",

After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  \n  \nI understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed.

And thanks for the discussions.",
        "argument": "1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ngô Đình Diệm isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after Điện Biên Phủ, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, Hồ Chí Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one\n\nBack to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia dình tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...\n\nMy point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place \n\n2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the \"hottest\" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called \"spread of Communism\", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)\n\n3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place. \n\nI can't believe you despise the Vietnamese gov't because of Communism. It's a fail economic model that Vietnam got rid of in 1986. The party retain the name for historical reason, and more importantly, its nature is NATIONALIST, and a political platform for all people. [One-party system is totally democratic if you keep different opinions among its memebers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOsjSKKPWMc). If you think multi-party platform could work in Vietnam, then consider what happen in South Vietnam during the war, and how they set up a dictatorship after. \n\nYou should remember that Vietnam is war-free in 1989, so its economy has short time to recover and develop. Compare Vietnam economy to Korea's and Japan's one disregard circumstances is just compare apple to orange. Remember that the war would be completely averted in [1945](http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=228) and [1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conference_%281954%29).

I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. \"That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want\". I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. \n\nI see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. \n\nAnother reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.\n\nChange my View Reddit!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "There are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?\n\nAlso let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?\n\nAdditionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.\n\nUltimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem, someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce.",

I am ONLY trying change your opinion on this particular segment of your reasoning: \"...this was wrong to do, *because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented*.\" I totally agree that Bernie Sanders has one of the better records on civil rights among the candidates who are running. However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better. By targeting Sanders, who is already a relatively good candidate on race, people can put pressure on him to make race a primary element of his campaign and to refine his opinions on policies regarding racism and social justice. \n\nI don't know what the motivations of these women necessarily were (their message was VERY muddied by a lot of factors) and I don't think their actions were appropriate or helpful at this time. But I think the idea that Bernie Sanders should be free of criticism on racial issues specifically because he has a decent history on them is silly.

Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out.  It's a disability that a person does to themselves.  It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability.  However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks.\n\nHere's a comparison that I use.  Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason.  You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled.  You did it to yourself, and you could have made different life choices to avoid becoming disabled, but you are disabled all the same.  You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese.  For example, depression leads to overeating for many people.\n\nSo why should obese people be denied some of the \"benefits\" of being disabled, just because they did it to themselves?\n\nAnd I hate that I feel like I have to even say this, but no, I am not overweight, and I do not have any personal agenda.

        "argument": "I have a couple different points to make, so this might not be very organized. But the context of when and how the discussion comes up matters.\n\n1: Imagine you have a dude who doesn't have a leg because he carelessly cut is off with a hacksaw. Then you have an obese person who is too big to walk. They both go to a grocery store and there is one scooter. Well the amputee can't walk because he has one leg. The obese person could just stop eating so much, and maybe wouldn't be so big if they'd just walk. In fact, they probably SHOULD be walking. When people say obesity isn't a disability, I think it usually comes up in a context like this, where people try to use obesity as a way of getting out of basic activities of daily living or to get special accomodations. People generally don't like the idea of someone getting special treatment because they are too lazy to walk, or don't have the self-control to maintain their health. It's kind of more like someone who complains about being thirsty, but won't drink water.\n\n2: Obesity can cause disabilities, but isn't a disability in and of itself. Again, people lose sympathy when it is something where people make a daily decision to stay that way. \n\n3: Sometimes people will blame their obesity on their health conditions, rather than their health conditions on their obesity. So when a person says they can't exercise because they have a bad back or bad knees or whatever else and that's why they're obese, the common sentiment is that \"no, you aren't disabled, you're just fat.

I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways.\n\nEconomy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamics/lower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price.\n\n \nAutomatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers \"manual shifting\" anyways. \n\nI believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more.\n\nThis leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe:\n\nHigh end 400-500+ HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference.\n\nAnd for manual transmission:\n\nOld classic imitation cars for the nostalgia? They're plainly under performing now.\n\nWhenever I see a Bentley or Benz S550/600 coupe, I cringe a bit since they're very obviously not performance based cars. \n\nManual freaks who refuse to own any other cars also seem illogical as hell. \n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\nPlease leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.

So if you don't watch it, or intend to, perhaps this is a good time to skedaddle.\n\n[Tonight's episode featured a rape scene.](/sp) I Googled 'game of thrones rape' to find that within an hour of the episode airing, several prominent publications had already posted articles with titles like 'Did Game of Thrones go too far?' 'Was that rape scene necessary?' etc. etc. I don't even want to check Twitter because I have a feeling it's full of the same.\n\nA rape scene! Outrage! When will rape culture stop!? GoT went too far!\n\nYet the show also depicts HUNDREDS, literally HUNDREDS of murders. Murders of babies. Murders of parents in front of the children. Casual murder. There was a murder of an unborn child in one episode. \n\nYet the only reaction people have to those is that \"they miss that character\" or \"OMG I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.\"\n\n**HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT SAYING:** I'm not saying that rape is acceptable, or that we should just sit back and enjoy it when it's depicted on film. That scene was hard as hell to watch. I'm also not saying that we should be outraged that Game of Thrones (or any show for that matter) is ultra violent and depicts so much murder. \n\nBut I think it's absurd to get worked up about a show depicting something terrible (rape) while totally ignoring that it constantly depicts something that is, in my opinion, worse (murder). \n\nChange my view.\n\nEDIT: I guess I need to clarify a bit, as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be \"offended\"/\"outraged.\" I have no problem with people being personally offended by something, either because it invokes a memory, or they simple find it difficult to sit through. To clarify my position, being offended by something, and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it, is ridiculous. \n\nExample of what I'm talking about (scroll down for Twitter reactions as well):\n[here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/11612290/rape-game-of-thrones.html)\n\n**EDIT 2: Really wish I had worded things better, but it's fine, I think it still made for a good discussion. I'm gonna stop responding to most things now, because I think enough people share my view that I'm not necessarily needed. Also, I do apologize if this ruffled any feathers or brought up any rough memories for anyone--it's always challenging to discuss rape in a careful yet constructive way, so I hope it went that way for the most part.

To clarify my position, being offended by something, and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it, is ridiculous.\n\n\nI think the AV Club nails it this week as to why this scene was not okay [link](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/game-thrones-newbies-unbowed-unbent-unbroken-219566):\n\n&gt;**Game Of Thrones has whiffed with this type of development in the past [rape], failing to treat an established reality within its universe with the proper amount of gravity. In the episode’s one majorly sour note, “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,” swings too far in the opposite direction**, as the ominous score, the characters’ reactions, and the involvement of Ramsay all scream “Game Of Thrones does not endorse sexual assault!” **Here’s an example in which bluntness was the incorrect tactic, deployed largely to demonstrate to Sansa what a horrible dude she’s married. Whether or not this was a complete misstep will depend on whether or not the rape has repercussions on anything deeper than a story level—something that, as Myles points out in the experts review, Game Of Thrones isn’t equipped to handle**, on account of how many characters and stories are being dealt with each episode. I’d like to think the people who make the show have learned from past mistakes with Daenerys and Cersei, but I could just be lying to myself.\n\nAlso, in the comment sections on the AV Club article, a user named Alien Jesus made two great points:\n\n&gt;**Worse, in this case it did not bring anything new in defining an already repellent character, it merely exists, gratuitous, leaving a horrible taste in the mouths of your fanbase.** \n\n&gt;**It also transcends merely poor choice, it’s borders on the obscene.**\n\nI mean, there's really not a way to depict rape that isn't obscene, but honestly I thought they were going to fade out of that scene about 1 minute or so before they did - and that last minute has pure horror. It was unnecessary on both counts: no added character development or plot point, and went on for too long and was too graphic and horrifying. They could have just alluded to the fact by cutting out a minute or two earlier and it wouldn't have been as bad. \n\nBoth the scene and the rape itself didn't *have* to happen. And it was depicted so horrifyingly. \n\nYou state that you think murder is worse than rape, but while the end result is worse because it's final, I think the experience of being raped or tortured (rape IS torture) is worse than experience of being murdered. The torture of Theon, the flaying scenes, the sexual violence, and the emotional torture are the most horrifying parts of the show for me, perhaps equally. But they were all in the books. This was the first time one of our main characters got tortured when she wasn't in the books, so that's why people are taking to the internet saying it shouldn't have happened.  ",

        "text": "Hello everybody! \n\nI was in a reddit thread earlier where someone was preaching the importantce of teaching personal finance in schools, encouraging people to start pension contributions as soon as they start earning, ect. ect. \n\nI'm an economics undergrad so I have a little (it is only a little) understanding of savings, but I believe that a drastic increase in savings would be a catastrophe for a few reasons:\n\n1) Intrest rates. The current interest is LOW, if not negative in real terms. This means that there arn't sufficient (safe) borrowers to allocate the funds to. Increasing the savings more risks entering a liquidity trap.\n\n2) Stagnation of demand. If you encourage people to save then they arn't spending (obviously). This is probably the worst thing that could happen right now (or in the next few years). \n\n3) Asset price bubbles. With lots of savings being depositied banks will be forced to 'do' something with that money.  Some of the things they will do is buy assets, or lend to buyers of assets: such as Bonds, stocks, property. ect. Rapid increases in the purchase of these has historically lead to their prices becoming speculative. It also prices out of the market the very people who you are teaching should save: Young people. \n\n\nSo thats why  I think encouraging, on mass, a new generation of young people to start savings to that degree would end badly.\n\nI want to understand why others think it shoudl be encouraged so I'm posting here. ",

I think teaching personal finance is essential. It is a life skill that will impact everybody. There aren't many high school subjects that can make that claim.\n\nHow many people will have a credit card during their lifetime? Shouldn't we explain to them things like what an APR is and how much paying only the minimum due actually costs? Perhaps help kids understand how much a car really costs beyond just the money they need to put up for a down payment? How does a bank account work and how do I open one? How does paying taxes work? How many deductions should I claim on a W4 when I start a new job? What is a credit rating and how does it affect me? These are important life skills that we don't even attempt to address in high school.\n\nA separate question is whether such a personal finance course should encourage saving. I maintain it should. At an honors level I'd consider going further and teaching basics of investments.\n\nUS savings rates are low. Very low. Here's a chart from the St Louis Fed showing the US personal savings rate over the last 60 years:\n\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PSAVERT\n\nHere's a list from the World Bank showing Gross Savings as a % of GDP:\n\nhttp://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc\n\nFor us to increase savings from this baseline to a level where the drop in consumption was enough to cause a problem just isn't a realistic concern. On the other hand, we continually expect people to be more capable of taking care of themselves with less help. Defined Benefit Plans are a thing of the past, replaced by Defined Contribution Plans. Retirement savings in vehicles such as a 401k or IRA require the individual to do at least some management of their own assets.\n\nAs an econ student you know the power of compounding, but not everybody does. Beginning your retirement savings in your 20s has a massive effect on when you can retire and how well you can live in retirement. \n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/compound-interest-and-young-people-2015-4\n\nNot everybody can afford to start saving at a young age, but why not explain to them in high school what the effects are and why it helps to try?",

        "argument": "Let me start by saying I'm a fan of Win *8.1* (the .1 being the key there).  And still appreciate what Win8 was trying to do.  So my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably don't care.\n\n&gt; The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu.\n\nThe problem is that it's considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they don't like that.  So in order to access your programs in Win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop.  With Win8 however, going into the Start Screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar.  So for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their Start it's incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side.\n\nAnother issue (which I still kinda have with it, even though it doesn't happen often) is when you accidentally hit the Win key it pulls you out of whatever you're working on and into a completely different screen.  In Win7 if this happened all you'd see is the menu pop up and you'd just click off it to get back to work.  In Win8 you have to find the Desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again.  The process is non-ideal.\n\nI also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes.  You can do two sizes, and stack them in a column.  I think they should have taken the \"snap to grid\" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the Start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your OCD.\n\n&gt;  if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu\n\nI'm an advocate of this, however you have to remember that the majority of PC users are *not* incredibly bright.  So for instance if my father wanted to get a new laptop then he's got to figure all that stuff out on his own (not likely), I need to babysit him through the process on the phone, or I need to just do it myself.  And since it's a third party software, it's possible that it'll break for one reason or another in which case either he's got to fix it (not likely) or I need to fix it (annoying).\n\n&gt; To change my view here you should tell me if there's something worse than the start screen in Windows 8 that makes it that bad. Or if the start screen really is that bad.\n\nSo depends on who you are.  I don't mind the Start screen but there are a lot of people who absolutely *loathe* it.\n\nOther things wrong with Win8:\n\n - Charms menu.  Every time my cursor wanders over to a corner I get an annoying Charms menu pop up.  If I have a multi monitor setup (which I do now) if I *do* want to get to the Charms I have to balance my cursor between screens, making it nearly impossible to get on a single try.  It's also kinda useless.  I've nearly forgotten it's there on my desktop since all of its functionality is available elsewhere (at least from what I've used).\n - Lack of Start button (fixed with 8.1).  In Win8 there was no Start button, so the only way to get to the Start menu was hitting the Win key or going all the way to the corner with the cursor.  Annoying.\n - Shut down (fixed in 8.1, kinda).  In Win8 if you want to restart/shut down/sleep it's a several key/click process.  You need to get to the start menu, then open the charms bar, then select settings, then power options, then select what you wanna do.  It's a kind of hidden process, and really annoying if you don't know how to do it.  Once you do know, you think \"why is this a several step process when it should be like Win7?\".  Win 8.1 *kinda* fixes this by allowing you direct access with a right click of the Start button, or directly on the Start Screen.  I say *kinda* because a right click is non-ideal and non-obvious and putting it on the Start screen means you still need to use the Start Screen.\n - Direct to Start Screen on boot (fixed in 8.1, with a settings change).  Booting up goes right to the Start Screen rather than the desktop.  Annoying.  Fixed with a settings option in 8.1, but it should be default.\n - Full screen apps (kinda fixed with 8.1).  Full screen apps on a desktop (or even laptop) are a terrible idea.  Win 8.1 kinda fixes this by docking them on the taskbar, but full screen apps are still a terrible idea.  They need to be windowed or the option to have them windowed, period.  For someone who wants to look at more than one thing (laptop and desktop users) having Mail taking up your entire screen is a drag.\n - General hidden features.  Things that should be obvious are hidden.  You need to hunt a corner to pop a menu out, accessing \"all apps\" from the Start Screen there's a *hidden* arrow button, right clicking contextually to find things (like the shut down point before) etc.  Not to mention all the stuff buried in the Charms bar.  There's too much hidden stuff that's only nice if you already know where it is.\n - General touch-oriented approach.  A lot of stuff is designed with touch in mind, like the Tiles.  Great if you have a touchscreen, and janky looking if you don't. \n - Too much tied in with MS.  They really try to get you to make an MS account, and tie your login with said account.  I absolutely hate that.  It makes things like Onedrive on the desktop inaccessible because of this integration, as opposed to just having the application take whatever credentials it needs.  If you chose to shirk making and signing in with an MS account, you lose some of the perks Win8 brings to the table.\n - Multiple PC settings areas.  So you've got the standard Control Panel, then you've got this \"Settings\" area that has some repetition from Control Panel, then some other stuff not in Control Panel that should be integrated into just Control Panel.  It's also a full screen app...ughhhh.  So if you wanna set something, you have to hunt through an already kinda cryptic Control Panel, but also through this new Settings app.\n - Repetition of functionality.  There's a lot of different ways to do one thing.  Shut down is yet again an example of this.  Device management is another (Control Panel, Settings app, Charms bar).  Search is another (Win+S, Start menu then type something, Charms bar).  There is way too much repetition.\n\nSo all in all, if you're not a savvy user (like most) then updating is a real pain in the ass.  8.1 does fix a lot of flaws 8 had, and Win10 supposedly brings a lot of that stuff even closer to Win7 (Start menu).  Win10 is what Win8 should have been.\n\nAnd in reality, there's ways around just about every nit up there.  Problem is, that if you have to find a way around something in order to get to experience the better things and improvements Win8 has to offer then that's a bad thing and deserving of a lot of the hate that Win8 has garnered.",

        "argument": "I think your Idea is flawed from the beginning.\n\n1) College/University is an option not mandatory. Add to that, Post Secondary Education is becoming less and less important. I don't think that it will ever go away, but I think the way we look at College is going to change over the next few decades (this is obviously an opinion).\n\n2) Paying for college should be the students responsibility. I did it on my own, just as millions of other have done it. With literally 0 help from my family, because they could not financially afford it. I worked 2 jobs, fixed iPhone's, and studied my ass off to graduate. But I did it. I was financially independent by the time I was 14. My parents haven't paid for anything except a home and food until I was 22 and moved out. I commend any parent that can help their child pay for a higher education. But it's not reasonable to expect a free ride.\n\nThe idea that your parents are responsible for paying for your education is misguided and selfish. You should work hard just like your parents did to pay for their educations and everything they have. Don't be lazy, don't expect hand outs, they don't come to you in the real life. If you want something, work for. Hustle, do what ever it takes to pay the bills. If your not willing to do that, you can't blame anyone but yourself.",

        "text": "I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. \nHere's a few reasons why I find it selfish.\n\n1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.\n\n2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.\n\n3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the \"right\" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it. \n\n\nHonestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

        "argument": "The world has always revolved around people having children.  It is innate in our biological make up to want to have children and raise them.   If everyone felt like you did, we'd have an opposite problem. In fact, Japan does have that problem and the US could be not too far behind them some believe.   While true plenty of children could use a good home, that doesn't take away the biological desire to have your own children and the good that can come of having your own.    I can't see why you can't do both. \n\nI'm not so sure hunger is an over population problem as much as a logistics or greed problem.   We have plenty of food to feed everyone in the world now, we just don't distribute it correctly.   You sound like a smart person, we could use smart genes being passed down into the pool.  That is a helpful thing to society.  \n\nYour last point is a strange one indeed.  I'm atheist, not agnostic, but we'll leave that argument for another time and place.   However, being as I am, I can really address your beliefs on that point as they're not mine, so I'd just leave it to say that's a really remote thing to concern yourself with over wanting to have kids.   \n\nI love my kid.   Not only does he look like me but he acts like me too, its evident even though he's only 3.  I think the bond we'll have when he's older is far stronger than anything I could achieve if I adopted a kid, who I could love equally, but I'm not sure the same bond would exist.    Evolution has spent a long time perfecting things and there's a reason you _want_ to have a child, and why that child acts and looks like you.   ",

        "text": "First, I'd like to point out that I'm well aware of the history of blackface, and the older utilization of it to offensively portray some awful stereotype of black people is racist. However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate? There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout \"racism!\"\n\nFor example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist.",
        "argument": "Because I surprised myself with how much I rambled here, **TL;DR:** People that color their faces to look like they belong to a different racial group might not be racists, but blackface as a symbol is racist.\n\nTo me this post is all about words, symbols, and context. I think there are so many questions raised by your post that won't fit in this comment: \"Does wearing blackface make you a racist?\"; \"Don't the speaker's/actor's intentions matter before labeling them racist?\"; \"Who decides what is/isn't racist?\"; \"At what point does history stop controlling our modern conceptions of racism?\"; \"Aren't we limiting free expression by restricting certain kinds of performance?\" Let me start by saying that I'm sorry your friend was caught up in the crap-storm that is the social media hate-echo chamber. Based on the story you told, I don't think it's fair to call her racist. I'll also say that I totally get where you're coming from. You're saying that your friend was simply trying to portray Michelle Obama who is incidentally black, and did not say or intend anything racist by it. So I'm going to take a stab at how you're thinking by walking through a question: \"Is the word 'wet back' racist?\"\n\nI think that question alone does not lend itself to an easy answer. The only reason \"wet back\" is a \"bad\" word is because we associate it with a disparaging image of undocumented Latino immigrants crossing the Rio Grande in Texas. But if I get out of the shower and forget to dry off my back, I can exclaim, \"Ah dammit I have a wet back,\" and no one bats an eye. Everyone knows that's different than *calling* someone a wet back. I'm assuming that you consider blackface as a symbol in the same light, and in a sense you're right. Words and symbols definitely have meaning, but that meaning only comes from context that we give it.\n\nSo it would obviously be way worse if your friend included references to Michelle Obama's race in her satire. But she didn't and did not intend to offend in her portrayal. So do intentions matter for context? Definitely. You know your friend better than I ever will, but I imagine that she's not a racist.\n\nHowever, intention is only one part of the story. *We* give meaning to symbols, not just the person who happens to employ it. How a specific community receives a word or symbol is just as valid in considering whether or not something is racist. If I walk past a group of Mexican Americans and bemoan my crappy drying skills with the same sentence, they might mishear me and think I'm actually using the \"wet back\" slur. It might take a really careful conversation to clear the air after something like that. The relevant community sensitive to the offending word or symbol has opinions and perceptions that are valid just like the speaker's and ought to be respected. So here's the point in two parts: **1) As far as words and symbols go, context matters. 2) While intention of the speaker/performer plays a role in creating that context, so does the reception by the relevant audience/community.**\n\nLet's take this out of language and talk about non-verbal symbols. Let's go big and talk about swastikas! Imagine that a kindergartener draws a picture at school and he unwittingly draws the Nazi swastika (as opposed to its incarnations in eastern religions). Is the teacher gonna hang that picture alongside everyone else's pictures? The teacher would probably not, and would hopefully explain that the symbol is bad and represents bad things. Why is a swastika so offensive? On a physical level, it's merely two intersecting lines with two 90 degree angles per line. But it has come to *represent* one of the most atrocious moments in human history.\n\nBlackface is a similar symbol. The history you cited in your post is really critical for the context of blackface. As you know, blackface itself is a symbol representing much sadder and more racist times in America. If you google blackface, you will certainly find references to that burdensome history and I doubt that you'll find many neutral definitions that omit those references. I'm not black, but I imagine that this history was evoked for the relevant audience when they saw your friend. Regardless of what your friend did or said, the symbol was there and prompted the reaction. So your friend is not a racist for coloring her face to look like Michelle Obama, but blackface as a symbol is racist.\n\nI very quickly wanted to comment your question about actors and theatrical performances that may call for a white actor coloring their face to appear black. I don't know if you've seen Tropic Thunder, but Robert Downey Jr. goes \"full blackface.\" It's actually like blackface-ception. He puts on blackface to portray in the movie a white actor that surgically augments his skin color to look black for a part. If you haven't seen it, go for it. It's a funny movie, but it was not without its controversy (google \"Tropic Thunder Blackface\"). Robert Downey Jr. probably isn't racist. That controversy just raises more questions that make me tired to think about (Is it ok to put on blackface to portray someone putting on blackface?).\n\nFor purposes of this comment, I think you yourself would agree that blackface the symbol is \"racist.\" You concede that what your friend did was in \"bad taste.\" I would agree. I would say the actions were in bad taste precisely because the symbol employed is racist. It doesn't make her a racist, and it doesn't mean that Michelle Obama is immune from satirical portrayal. It just means that anyone thinking about putting on blackface should know that they are in dangerous territory because (a) blackface is a symbol that signifies a troubled and racist history; and (b) the black community will likely react negatively to uses of the symbol because of its historical context.\n\nHope I changed your view!",

        "text": "The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).\n\n[Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)\n\nOne could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.\n\nThe people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.\n\nIf a \"buffer\" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.\n\nAlbeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution. Which is why I'm here, what is wrong with this plan?\n\n**Edit:** Added what can happen with the people already living there.",
        "argument": "One basic way of refuting this idea is by simply looking at the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula. \n\n\n\nFirst, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. \n\nAlso, Israel might have been \"mostly dessert\" but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. \n\nEgypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon. But sure, in a perfect world, that could theoretically happen. (Are you familiar at all with what is going on in this region??, are we talking about the same Egypt, the northern Africa country that has gone through three leaders in the past five years? The one with the pyramids?)\n\nI'm not even sure I want to talk about a buffer zone right now. Its late, and the current buffer zone is being executed so terribly and horrendously right now that I do not think that term should be uttered in geopolitical conversations concerning this region. \n\nI guess more than anything I am confused by your view prompt. Are you saying that if the things you mentioned happened that a Palestine state could thrive? \n\nI mean if the planets align and ponies sprout wings with rainbows coming out their butts, then yea sure this might happen. I would rather you suggest Utah as a solution, or maybe suggest building an island in the middle of the ocean out of old two litter bottles of soda. At least then, there is a more realistic possibility. ",

        "text": "* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.\n* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future. \n \nFurther information:\n\nExamples of diseases or ailments.\n•Congenital Anomalies\n•Malignant Neoplasms\n•Heart Disease\n•Cancers which meet the definition below.\n•Live disease\n\nDiseases associated with high mortality rates and high treatment costs\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the comments.

        "argument": "At least in the USA, the government is a democracy, in which all people should have a say. The government should therefore mirror all its peoples' interests. The group for chronically ill does exist, so is it not fair that they at least receive some recognition in government? If people have an interest in having government-subsidized chronic disease healthcare then the government should at least somewhat represent those people.\n\nWhen one observes the art and literature left behind from the Black Death, one can see that the people were suffering. Grotesque images of the infected as well as hysteria over what caused the disease ran rampant. The misery of the general public could not be understated, as a force outside their control killed their loved ones without discretion. If such a kind of suffering was to happen, and people knew exactly who was to blame, is it not reasonable to conclude that deaths of chronically ill which affected people would cause the affected to conduct civil unrest?\n\nThe argument that GDP will increase is somewhat flawed by itself. The government has actually produced something known as a stimulus check to boost consumer spending in times of recession. Taxdollars which go through the government would still increase the country's GDP because the government still spends money on subsidizing chronic medication. If the proposed system of removing government funding was introduced, then that same money would instead go directly to charities and thereby go to health expenditure. The GDP would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. The government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue.\n\nIn addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. Those people who have chronic asthma aren't really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. How does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? Some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. If the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age. Obviously, they were suffering from old age, right? 80 years is definitely the right cutoff age and is definitely not an arbitrarily drawn number, right?",

I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.\n\nSo with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other.

        "argument": "The main problem with your argument is that gays are a *class* of people, while people with incestuous feelings are just individuals with incestuous feelings.\n\nBasically, it is wrong to discriminate against people simply because they belong to a specific group. It is, however, perfectly OK to discriminate against individuals because of their individual traits.\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_classification#Federal_classifications) are some of the legal definitions of what constitutes a 'class' of people. I'm not going to summarize 'em. You have to do some work and read 'em yourself. But the two main groups are the suspect classes and the rational-basis classes. *Suspect* classes include race or religion, and the government needs to show a compelling reason to allow discrimination. *Rational-basis* classes are groups like criminals vs. non-criminals, where there may be a rational reason to allow discrimination.\n\nTwo choice quotes:\n\n&gt;In Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a **suspect** class[...]\n\nand:\n\n&gt;Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a **quasi-suspect** classification\n\nHere you have the courts arguing over which kind of classification that gays belong to (*suspect* vs. *quasi-suspect* class) but agreeing that gays do belong to something stronger than just a rational-basis classification.\n\nSiblings with incestuous feelings? I guarantee they would fall under the 'rational-basis' classification, meaning there is a lower bar for the gov't to clear in order to justify discrimination.",

        "text": "I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it).\n\nMost people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.\n\nEven bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being \"annoying\" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.\n\nAnother reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.\n\nAnother reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a \"tough on crime\" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.\n\nWe punish people because we perceive them as \"deserving it\" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.\n\nI actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider \"bad\" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You may either push the other person off the bridge, which will stop the trolley before it hits the 5 people, which will kill that person, or you can do nothing, which will kill the 5 people. I add the rule that the trolley will not stop if it hits you, and will only stop if it hits the person with you, which eliminates the \"I'll jump myself\" answer and keeps the idea of the scenario in place.\n\nI believe that the proper solution is to push the person off the bridge. The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset. By neglecting to push the other person off the bridge, you have prioritized your own moral standpoint over the lives of not just one, but 5 other people. The idea that one should not kill may be generally applicable, but to effectively condemn other people to die because you do not want to compromise your morals is incredibly selfish, and goes against the implied deontological principle that one should prioritize the needs of others over one's own (especially if one's needs are really wants).

Also, among their treatment options, you've got \"movement classes\", yoga, and meditation. If it were truly a mental illness, wouldn't it be a little hard to just will away? These treatment options seem to just be a really nice ways of saying...go on a diet.\n\nI don't want to be insensitive about this subject, thus why I'm here.

        "argument": "So it's important to define what including a disorder (not a disease) does and doesn't do for psychiatric conditions. The point of defining disorders is so they can be looked at collectively across healthcare providers, researchers, and insurers. Etiology is not necessary to find before defining a disorder. For a disorder to be a thing enough people have to have similar sets of symptoms. Mental illness can come from multiple sources, your depressin can be genetics or a bad childhood or from chronic adult stress. And it's not correct to say anorexia and bulimia stem from body image issues. That's certainly the case for some but it's not a necessary feature. \n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is having a diagnosis doesn't absolve you of responsibility from your problem, it just means that medicine recognizes that it's far more difficult for you to overcome the problem with just the tools in your own head. Some people overeat and binge but can overcome the urge with their own mental resources, just like some people feel down but can overcome it with their own thoughts or habits. Likewise, bed just gives a framework for describing a problem many people have so we can give treatments. ",

        "text": "First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:\n  \n1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   \n  \n2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   \n  \n3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  \n  \n4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow.",

Very curious to say what the responses are!\n\nJuveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,\n\nTrying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?\n\nEDIT:\nI think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].\n\nAlso, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.\n\n\n[1] http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24173194 \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.\n* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control.

This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain.

If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

(There will soon be an injection you can get in your junk that functions as a permanent contraceptive until you reverse it, cool right?)

In a lot of places they aren't even legal, and in places where they are, there are all kinds of people trying to make them illegal. If you're a woman who gets an abortion (if you're lucky enough to be in a place where it's legal and accessible) you'd better not talk about it because people will judge you for it and you could lose friends or jobs.

        "title": "CMV:The way women are portrayed in video games has no negative effect on society",
        "text": "I’m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I’m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There’s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.\n\nWhen I won the grand prix my girlfriend said “Ugh, I hate Peach, she’s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.” To which I jokingly replied “Wow, that’s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she’s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.” And her response to that was “Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.”\n\nThen I made the mistake of saying “Well I don’t think that’s true.” We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.\n\nThere were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don’t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it’s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn’t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.\n\nThe second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They’re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33466-001/). Most reasonable people realize that women don’t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.\n\nI provided my argument, and also said if Mario’s and Peach’s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.” I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.”\n\nSo here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I’m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? \n\nEDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than \"It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt\"\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "I study media representations a little bit and might be able to address the points you raise.\n\nYou first point, that there are a ton of bad-ass female characters, may seem subjectively true but in the general demographic context of video games it is incorrect. There are certainly quite a few notable examples of bad-ass female characters but, in general, females are dramatically underrepresented in video games. A [content analysis of 150 video games from 2009](http://nms.sagepub.com/content/11/5/815.abstract) found that 85% of all video game characters were male. Of the 15% of characters that are female, the \"bad-ass\" characters are most definitely the exception. And even the \"bad-ass\" female characters are often still portrayed in highly gendered and sexualized ways. So even though you can call to mind several examples of non-helpless female characters, the fact remains that females are dramatically underrepresented and non-helpless female characters are only a portion of the already small number of female characters in video games. So, I don't think saying there are \"a ton of bad-ass female characters\" is an accurate reflection of actual video game demographics.\n\nYour second point will probably be the more difficult one to change your mind about. You doubt that there is any connection between the way women are portrayed in video games and the way people think about and behave towards women in real life. Without getting too academic, I'll say that every person can be thought of as the result of a whole bunch of psychological and cultural ingredients. Some ingredients predispose a person to be a certain way and do certain things, while other ingredients do the opposite or cancel out effects. What this means is that it's never as simple as saying \"exposure to sexualized women will make someone a hostile sexist\" or \"exposure to violent video games will cause someone to be a violent criminal.\" There are way too many other things going on to be able to make such a direct causal statement. However, repeated exposure to certain things most definitely changes the way you think about them, and these changes in the way you think about things then becomes one of the ingredients that makes you who you are and influences what you do. \n\nFor an academic look at how we are all products and perpetuators of the society's we're part of the products we create and consume, read [this](http://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2010-Markus-Kitayama_Culture-and-Self-A-cycle-of-mutual-constitution.pdf).\n\nSo with that said, let's talk about evidence that the media we consume can change the way we think about things. In another comment here, /u/fluffhoof mentions [this study](https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf) about the psychological effects of embodying a sexualized avatar. As a contrast to the single study you shared about violent video game effects, a [meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of violent video games](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192553) found that playing violent video games was related to increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect, as well as decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. There are plenty of other examples where these come from and they all suggest that the kind of media we're exposed to can have real effects on the way we think about ourselves, and certain people and issues. Just because you don't become a hostile sexist or violent criminal after playing video games doesn't mean that they didn't have an effect on you.\n\nMost of us probably have enough other ingredients in us that have to do with being egalitarian and reasonable and peaceful or whatever else, that the effects of exposure to this kind of media don't manifest themselves in obvious ways. But if you are repeatedly exposed to portrayals of women as helpless and sexualized, you will most likely think of women differently than if you hadn't been repeatedly exposed to those portrayals. And even if the only effect that exposure to these portrayals has on us is that we accept these portrayals as \"good\" or \"normal\" or \"typical of women\" or even just \"not unusual\" or \"not bad\" then it does a disservice to women in society by continuing to limit the way women are perceived and allowing the cycle of biased representations to continue.\n\nAlso, your girlfriend's point that \"you won't ever understand because you're a guy\" is absolutely true. You (if you're a male living almost anywhere in the world) have lived your life in a world where men are abundantly represented in real life and the media. Not only that but men are portrayed in a huge variety of ways: in positions of power, prestige, and notoriety as well as in positions of poverty, shame, and powerlessness, and so on. The point is that men have long enjoyed a very wide spectrum of representation, meaning that when someone thinks \"What is a man like?\" there is ample information to draw from and one can selectively draw from information that portrays men favorably. Women (and minorities) do not have that experience. Women are underrepresented in most media and they are represented in much narrower and limited ways than men are. So when one asks the question \"What is a woman like?\" the information one draws from is likely to be more scarce and more biased and this is likely to contribute to the perpetuation of people thinking that women are different than men in ways that they really aren't.\n\nI get it if my arguments for subtle media effects having important consequences for society are hard to buy into. I get that a lot. One way or another, thanks for reading! :)",

        "text": "Yes I'm an American male, and I don't know how things differ for women or those outside the United States, so I'll leave those two large groups out of the discussion. \n\nFor any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50% that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly:\n\n1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90%) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in.\n\n2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner.\n\n3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with #1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form.\n\nI think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable for the organization to be based out of San Francisco, where the 4 founding races formed the coalition of planets, but with 150 member planets spread over 8,000 light years, why is so much of the leadership human?\n\nThis isn't a superficial skin-color thing, we're dealing with marked biological differences between the races. Vulcans, despite their violent past, have achieved \"superhuman\" levels of mastery over their emotions, allowing them to become excellent administrators and politicians, and even if we were to assume that Humans and Vulcans have the same fundamental capacity for intelligence, Vulcan discipline gives them supreme focus to produce an inordinate concentration of highly educated citizens. Even in sheer physical prowess, Vulcans massively outclass Humans, \"Take me out to the Holosuite\" being an excellent example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Out_to_the_Holosuite\n\nHere, the Vulcans are shown to be physically far superior, DOMINATING the mixed-race (human dominant) crew fielded by the Human Captain, in a human sport, with a final score of 10-1. Nevertheless the crew of DS9 celebrate their single point as a victory of human will rather than learning from the experience that Vulcans are superior in so many ways. \n\nVulcans are known for logic, they take great efforts to avoid letting their emotions cloud their judgement. We all know of a prestigious Human starship captain for ignoring the odds in a situation and taking great risks over the protests of his even-keeled Vulcan officer. It's convenient that luck favored the crew so often after these brash and illogical decisions. These apparent \"successes\" for making the wrong decision only served to stroke this captain's ego and belief that his \"gut instincts\" are what qualify him to lead. How is this different from a foolish business executive making random decisions and claiming credit for successes, and blaming other factors for failures? The meritorious act is in the decision itself, not in the outcome. To judge the brash decision based on a fortunate outcome is a flawed post hoc reasoning, akin to throwing a dart, sliding a dartboard under it, and claiming an excellent throw! What if even a few of those risks resulted in the *likely* outcome where many if not all of the crew members were killed because the captain ignored the logical choice in favor of an unsupported gut decision? \n\nIf there are any flaws to be noted in the Vulcan people as a whole, it would be low birth-rates, a bias towards peace, and a relative lack of ego(despite whatever projections humans perceive in a Vulcan's taciturn face). Perhaps humans have seized so much power as a direct result of greed, ambition, and nepotism, allowing them to promote humans above more qualified non-human members of Starfleet? Nevertheless, it seems clear that Vulcans are superior to humans.\n\n(The tone's intentionally a bit tongue and cheek to make this discussion more fun, but the fiction really does seem to over-exalt humans in the Federation)",

However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.\n\nHowever, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation.

But it still matters quite a bit to those without one, and society as a whole still benefits because education doesn't exclusively serve to discriminate between potential employees.\n\n&gt;In countries like Germany and Denmark, only the best of students make it into higher education, whereas in American, our standards to get into a university or a community college are laughable. \n\nThen free tuition isn't the issue, all tuition changes is whether the rich benefit from this.\n\n&gt;The main argument here is that making college education free in our system would end up hurting the overachieving students.\n\n\"Overachieving\" students already show it by mechanisms other than simply getting out of university with a diploma.

        "title": "CMV: Jack of All Trades and a Master of None is Better than a Master of One",
        "text": "We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.  I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a \"master\" at some skill or aspect of your life.  \n\nWhat I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few \"trades\".\n\nFor starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.  \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is \"success\" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.   \n\nA Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is \"good\" at many things and a Master is \"great\" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.   \n\nI try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.  \n\nPlease don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.\n\nI am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.         \n\n**Edit** \nHere is the delta, thanks **AnecdotallyExtant**\n\n&gt;I will change your view with a single diagram.\nIt will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all.\nAs an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house -- nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid.\nSo again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity.\nWhich means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all.\n\nPlease read below if you want to see the diagram.

        "title": "CMV: The simplest, cheapest, most effective way to improve society would be encouraging and participating in more public interaction between strangers",
        "text": "I am not here to make an exhaustive (and certainly biased) list of what I believe is wrong with society/culture (specifically in America, where I live), but to suggest that all the issues could be moderated (if not necessarily solved) by establishing new attitudes and behaviors in public spaces and around strangers. It seems that my generation (recently dubbed, by some, the Oregon Trail Generation, existing between Gen-X and Millennials) was the first to be raised with explicit \"stranger danger\" warnings and programs like DARE, latchkey centers, etc. Since then, the stigma against strangers has only increased and our default attitude turned closer to fear and suspicion.\n\nIt would take a long time to dissect the various causes for this notable shift but at least some are clear: Modern media more constantly and sensationally depicts the negative potentials (often real, but sometimes illusory). The rapid growth of the internet and technology has given negative individuals access to our private lives and information (think 419 and phishing scams). A more connected and globalized society has shown us a greater number of negative outcomes (even when those numbers do not reflect a higher percentage or likelihood).\n\nI'm certainly not blaming technology for this, as the way we use it exists in a complex cycle of innate habits/desires, the capability of the technology, and a reinforcing feedback loop. Many of the issues are, however, exacerbated by technology because it gives us the ease to disseminate fear-based messages (which are naturally stronger than positive messages) and provides us with a secluded alternative to the public sphere. We can easily find people who agree with us, information that fulfills our search, and interactions that provide some positive stimulus without ever having to interact with strangers.\n\nThat said, the insular world we have created puts incredible distance between individuals even as it purports to bring us closer together. While it is wonderful that a person can find a community that shares and validates their unique interests, we are relieved of the burden of having to consider and integrate difference. Further, these habits have not only stratified society economically but subdivided it in all directions. For all the openness of the modern world, we are actually strengthening in-groups by creating social networks and dating sites that cater to race, religion, profession, etc. (I've been looking for research to support this statement, but precious little has been done.)\n\nAs I see it, nearly all of these issues would be alleviated by reinstating the public sphere as a place for interaction between strangers. I'm not saying you should talk to every person you see out and about and we definitely need to educate vulnerable groups/individuals on keeping safe (and have a police force capable of adequately and appropriately handling the situation). We could begin simply by discussing the arts when encountered in a public setting (ask a stranger what they thought of a movie instead of just your friends) and discussing news in public forums (why can't people in Boston Common have a conversation about the recent trial?). We should be more open to finding all kinds of relationships randomly, whether on the subway or in the grocery store. \n\nObviously, there will be lots of discomfort and inconvenience. You shouldn't talk to everyone, all the time, and it will take each individual an amount of trial and error to gauge what is and isn't appropriate. Still, the general outcome seems to be only positive. For most of the us, the worst outcome is encountering more annoying people, but I actually think \"wait til you hear about this guy I talked to at the gas station\" is more interesting than \"I went to the gas station and listened to this podcast that confirmed what I was already thinking.\" We would also be afforded new (that is, old) ways of dealing with issues that arise from online dating and MRA/SJW/etc. communities.\n\nMany people will chalk my attitude up to a rural midwest upbringing as a white male. No, I did not grow up in an area where gangs, drugs, etc. were likely encountered on any sort of regular basis; no, I was not at risk of racial or sexual harassment and related violence. I am, though, familiar with those experiences second-hand (my university had students from 35 states and 42 countries, so I was exposed to an extensive array of different cultures/attitudes/experiences) and actually believe my solution may alleviate them to some extent. A portion of perpetrators (admittedly the ones likely to do the least damage) may change their attitude and behavior because of their increased interactions with others. The worst offenders are likely to attempt/commit their actions regardless. Potential victims may actually gain allies and confidence from increased interaction (one specific ex: women who become comfortable approaching and speaking with men in public are more likely to find men who don't just want sex/dating and the women will demonstrate that they interesting, complex, equal people rather than just joining online groups intent on telling us they are interesting, complex, equal people).\n\nAm I really miscalculating the ratio of benefit/danger? Is there some insurmountable barrier to public interaction I'm not considering? Is this happening more often than I realize but just not in my area? \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "text": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around\", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. \n\nI want to make this point clear – I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.\n\nThe reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.\n\nGiven these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. \n\nOnce again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.\n\nTo illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.\n\nNow, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.\n\nThe difference between Bob and Patrick is this – Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.\n\nSo, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.\n\nNow, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.\n\nTo make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with \"crime.\" \n\nThanks!!!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We already have it! It’s the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly.\n\nWe should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute.\n\nSome of the points I have against road transport for individuals.\n\n\n•\tEnvironmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment.\n\n\n•\tSafety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade.\n\n\n•\tStress– While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers.\n\n\n•\tEnergy efficiency – A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars.\n\n\n•\tMaintenance – a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components.\n\n\n•\tEconomy – Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.\nHere are some points that I have for expansion of public transport.\n\n\n•\tBonus free time – When I’m in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it.\n\n\n•\tPotty Breaks – trains can be modified to have them, cars don’t. I’d have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go.\n\n\n•\tFuel Efficiency.\n\n\n•\tNoise reduction.\n\n\n•\tSkill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer.\n\n\nI am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have **today.** \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "I will be addressing this situation in the US, where public transit is generally not highly regarded and there is vast infrastructure for personal vehicles. I will also try to avoid cultural biases.\nI agree with your sentiment, However I don't view the two as alternatives to one another, nor is either one a complete solution to all transportation problems.\nmost major US cities would benefit from better and cleaner public transportation. This is held back in large part by the fact that the US is heavily invested in the massive personal transport infrastructure it already has, and attempts to reform the entire system could be very disruptive to public life.\nThere are also inherent limitations to public transportation. Traditional mass transit is not a good model for the widely-spaced, diffuse populations in a lot of the middle of the country. It is also an imperfect solution for people with disabilities: a member of my family is unable to drive due to visual impairment, and cannot walk very well due to partial paralysis in the leg. Even if suburban public transit provided a direct route from our town to where she works, it would be very difficult for her to make It to and from the station. A self driving vehicle could allow for a greater degree of mobility and autonomy for handicapped people.",

        "text": "New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong.\n\nBefore I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors.\n \nThe main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to \"let themselves go.\" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. \n\nSecondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.\n\nAll of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue.\n\nEdit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post.\n\n1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well.\n\n2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.\n\nLastly, a few of you pointed out the issues that arise when one spouse stays at home with the children and the other wants out of the marriage down the line. I do now see more of a purpose for it when the intention is to start a family. \n",
        "argument": "Marriages ending aren't attempting to penalize people, most of the typical \"downsides\" are actually benefits if you look at them in context. Yes, it sucks that you sometimes need to use the legal system to split your properties in half, but on the plus side, you have a system to ensure you can at least get half of the things the two of you owned as a couple. There are way's that this can be done without marriage at this point of course, but they still hold the same \"drawbacks\". another huge benefit is custody rights.\n\nThe argument of \"letting yourself go\" has nothing to do with actually getting married. it has to do with being around someone and not having feeling a strong pressure to find someone to be with. This happens with or without marriage, and its really down to the couple to handle that.\n\n&gt; Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.\n\nThe big issue here is that the alternative is much worse. This is usually about the person who has a larger income feeling they deserve more of the assets after the divorce, and not wanting to give that up. Yes, it can really suck, but imagine if assets were not split? Especially if there are children involved, things can get very complicated. Imagine a situation with one stay at home parent, and one employed parent. The couple made this decision because it made sense at the time, but now they are unhappy and wish to divorce. The stay at home parent has very few technical skills from not being a part of the work force, is the primary caretaker of the child and would likely have custody, and if they were not entitled to any of the assets that the employed parent had, they would really have nothing, despite that they were operating and working as a team.\n\nAnd yes, I am aware that legal fee's are quite high, and that's really the biggest issue. That being said, the legal protection is what makes a marriage a risk more safe. I would be less willing to share a bank account, and all of my possessions with another person if there was not any form of legal protection in place to help deal with that.",

        "text": "This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  \n\nMy wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  \n\nI hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    \n\nTL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  \n\nEdit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  \n\nEdit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  \n\nEdit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:\n\n1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  \n2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  \n3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   \n4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited\n5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  \n",
        "argument": "I think the blacks rights thing plays a big issue in this. It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. \n\nFor the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. \n\nAsians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population. It helps us get ahead as we are seen as \"smarter\" or \"hardworking\".  ",

        "title": "CMV: I believe that socialism is fundamentally better than capitalism",
        "text": "For the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.\n\nAnd that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.\n\nNot only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). \n\nSo, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.\n\nI guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!\n\nEDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "The vast majority of people in the United States that are currently unemployed are actively looking for work. An equally large number of people are also working part-time and not earning enough money to sustain themselves because they could not find full-time employment.\n\nMany of these people are either homeless, living off government benefits, or have a standard of living lower than what would be provided by a socialist government as a safety net for its citizens.\n\nAlternatively, in the example I proposed above, every one of those individuals could find some means of being employed by the government for decent housing and a livable wage: it might mean working a particular industry that needs it, returning to school to get new skills, etc, but they would find it. \n\nThe problems start to arise when you give a blanket promise that every industry gets those safety blankets. Professional poker players, code junkies, engineers, start-ups, artists, all students, musicians, street dancers, exhibitionists... at some point, you need to start defining what constitutes being a productive member of society. \n\nIf you start supporting all occupations, you will have an awful lot of carrier pigeon breeders actively looking for employment living on government benefits. Sure, you could hypothetically make a system work where all professions were acceptable, but you need to lay out some form of plan as to how to do it. It's not a matter of incidental problems. These are systemic problems that must be resolved for the system to function. \n\nBy defining particular industries that guarantee employment for the benefits of a safety blanket, you always give people an option to rely on. They might not be working in their ideal field, but they will always know that if their art fails, that they will never find themselves starving and out on the street. That still sounds like a safety blanket that everyone can use to me. \n\n",

        "title": "CMV: People who are \"saved\" by suicide hotlines aren't legitimately suicidal; they just have poor crisis management.",
        "text": "Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by \"legitimacy\" I'm talking about how valid the wish to die is in the first place. I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so.\n\nAlso, downvotes don't change views, people. \n\n***\n\nI've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me.\n\nMy personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management.\n\nI can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.) It seems like the wish to die in and of itself is a basis to claim that someone is not acting in their right state of mind, which I think is illogical and unfortunate. \n\nI know this paragraph was written somewhat messily, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to provide some context for my view. I will be happy to clarify anything for anyone that asks.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Seems very hypocritical, no?\n\nThe point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.\n\nIt all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The international competiton usually consists of a third-party tournament, the IEM World Championship, and two Riot organised events, the Mid Season Invitational and the Riot World Championship (the \"real\" worlds). Of these three only the Riot Worlds is the only really big tournament, with 16 teams and a good playoffs and group stage format.\nMSI features only the best team of each region and the IEM World Championship uses Bo1 groups into Bo3 in the first playoff bracket, which is often criticised as too random for the title.\nThe league structure in all major regions is usually divided into a spring and a summer league with a regular season of 18-40 games or so, followed by playoffs to see determine who the best teams in the region are.\n\nIn the other major eSport titles (Dota, SC2, CSGO) you have \n\n* way more tournaments in general\n\n* way more international competition in general\n\n* more important games, as you have more playoff situation\n\nThis all leads to my opinion that LoL eSports has the most boring circuit, as the majority of the matches that are being played are low impact matches in the regular season and only in domestic competition.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I would appreciate if you help me understand some of the arguments that you apparently think brushed aside.

        "text": "*“Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children.” - Marvin Minsky*\n\nSo firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future (maybe even only a few millennia), it will be by integrating ourselves with technology and shedding our fragile organic bodies.\n\nWhat is the maximum typical lifespan of a sentient organic species? Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant. Will the Earth still be inhabitable for us in our current states by the time another instant passes? Luckily, we’ve already started primitively engineering and augmenting ourselves, with genetic modification, prosthetic legs, hearts, ears, etc. The technological advances in just the last 100 years (as well as the damage we’ve done to our planet) has been incredible— what will the next 5,000 bring?\n\nLet’s assume for the sake of argument that the nearest sentient species developed on a planet 100 lightyears away. (Just FYI, a quick Google/Wolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200km/s, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let’s say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time— only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel.\n\nEssentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological ‘life’. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it’s much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it’s still fully organic.

        "argument": "This is an interesting thought, but you're basing it on a premise that aliens will be roughly on the same technological level as we are. Seems more probable that either of us will be in the stone age relative to another. So, either they won't have the concept of constructed things, or our concept of robots will be on the same level as an useful sharp stick that makes animals become food.\n\nWhat you might look into in this area is the Fermi Paradox (\"Where is everybody?\"). Basically, given the vastness of the Universe and the endless number of possibilities, there seems to be a significant chance of advanced alien civilizations being present; and it would surely be communicating and doing stuff on a large scale. But if so, how come we don't see any of that?\n\nSome of the logical explanations actually fit the idea that all aliens might be on roughly the same level. Let's say something (Reapers or whatever) resets any life on certain intervals, so all civilizations had about the same start not a very long time ago. But there are other options. Like, there's no aliens. Or, the aliens are so different that we actually see them all the time but don't understand it.\n\nAnother way to look at this: we don't even know how consciousness works yet. That's the reason there's no AI (not the lack of processing power). For example, to make airplanes, people first tried to replicate birds, and failed at that. Then they made something entirely unnatural based on the science of aerodynamics, and it actually worked. So, we don't have this brain science. Some say there's even something beyond just mechanics involved. A soul or whatever. So who's to say it is even possible to make a true AI or digitize a person?",

        "argument": "&gt;I do not think a girl has expressed even the slightest interest in me.\n\nA bit of a personal question here, but do you talk to girls? Do you have female friends or at least female acquaintances? You know, females you're familiar and friendly with? Because if not, I hate to break it to you, but real life isn't like movies. A girl won't spot you walking by and sigh in disbelieve or fall in love with you or anything like that.\n\nTo get the interest of a girl, you're going to actually have to talk to her. You're gonna have to talk to a lot of girls. Don't make getting a girlfriend your only reason to talk to a girl. Instead, talk to girls the way you talk to guys, and look for friendships with girls (I started doing this and personally, I found myself much more comfortable with female friends than male friends). This builds social connections, builds up your own experience, increases the chances of getting a girlfriend, etc... You just have to talk, that's about it. Many guys think they don't have girlfriends because they're fat or ugly or things like that, but girls aren't as superficial as guys, believe it or not. Us, guys, like to look at how the girl looks. Of course personality is important, but physical attraction is the more important factor for us. With girls, it's the other way around. They care about how guys look, but not as much as guys care about how girls look. To them, personality is much, much, MUCH more important than looks.",

        "text": "First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. This post is about the following:\n\nOften times someone might make the argument \"if you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about\" defending government collection of data. To counter people will bring up the \"bathroom lock\" analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong.\n\nMy problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of \"government back doors\". Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole. This is put in place with safety in mind - if something happens to you while you're in the bathroom someone can get in and save you without breaking down the door. I don't know about you, but this is something that comforts me.\n\nIn the same way that no one wants to see me shit and would only actually use this \"backdoor\" through the bathroom lock in emergencies, the government doesn't care about my email to my mom about my sisters birthday, and only actually use collected data when it might be of some help fighting terrorism.\n\n\nWhen I noticed this I couldn't think about any reason why what I have said above is wrong, so please, CMV.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If the government has a warrant to search your house or listen to your phone calls, they can do so.

        "title": "CMV: A system in which students offer \"shares\" of their future earnings is preferable to the current student loan system.",
        "text": "My post is inspired by [this article](http://www.ifyouonlynews.com/politics/chris-christie-suggests-students-sell-themselves-to-investors-to-pay-for-college/) in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell \"shares\" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education.    \n\nI have seen people criticize this system as one of \"indentured servitude\", presumably because for a period of years students could not be released from the requirement to pay a portion of their earnings to the investor(s). \n\nHowever, the current system of student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, amounting to a lifetime obligation anyway (or longer, if they die early and there are co-signers on the loan).  \n\nAdmittedly, fixed-amount loans are better for students who have unexpectedly high earnings -- so this system might discourage some risk-taking.  But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. \n\nA system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. \n\nThis is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs.  Thanks for weighing in!\n\nEdit #1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far.  One delta awarded at this point to /u/PlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree.  (/u/ngxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea.  I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks *should* take a back seat in this arena.)\n\nEdit #2: Whoa!  So many great comments and thoughts.  Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund.  And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts.  Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis.  Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school.   Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work).  Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field.  So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12% of your earnings (above a certain threshold -- see edit #1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3% of your earnings.  \n\nEdit #3:  Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion.  I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to /u/hacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor.  Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system:\n\n* Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks\n* Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically\n* Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system.\n* This deal would be better for some people than for others.  For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal.\n\nEven if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view.  Finally, there has been a lot of discussion premised (and I was guilty of this too, at first) on the notion that your field of study would be a major driver for attracting investors.  I'm coming around to the view that except in the case of very specialized programs (e.g. engineering, medicine), field of study won't be as big a factor as student achievement and quality of school overall. \n\nFrom this point forward, I may not respond to all (or any) further responses, except if I feel they are really adding something new.  Nonetheless, I hope the discussion continues with others participating as desired!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Absolutely changed their genres irrevocably in addition to the general culture; (possibly) even more than their popularity might suggest.\n\nBeyonce as an example would NOT fit this bill. There simply isn't anything \"new\" to her act. Her solo career is typical for a successful singer moving from group to solo etc. In other words... there isn't a \"Change\" that we can attribute to her. \n\nBands that started out before 2000 would also fall outside of this since it is \"within the last 15 years\"\n\nThere are also the usual songs that make it into the general consciousness in terms of jokes, references etc. But those always exist and don't signal a change in the society itself. \n\nEdit 2: I'm open to bands that might have formed before 2000, but didn't release an album until 2000. There are two reasons I chose this cutoff date. The first is the emergence of MP3's and the second is 9/11/2001. But I didn't want to draw attention to those ideas although a couple people did note that the former may have been the reason for the dearth of any \"big game changers\". \n\nEdit 3: I recognize that Marley and The Pistols are not American bands. Used them to indicate scope. \n\nEdit 4: For those claiming that 15 years isn't enough time... Each of the bands used as examples had made their cultural significance known within about 5-7 years of their first national exposure. (Ella, Armstrong and Marley are arguable exceptions) There is also at least one representative from each decade between 1940 and 2000 in the list.\n\nEdit 5: I KNOW I've been slow... I'm honestly listening to at least one track from each band that people have mentioned. Sometimes to acquaint myself with them, sometimes to remember them.  \n\nEdit 6: Kanye and Taylor Swift. I've read every argument you guys have given for them. And have yet to see a SINGLE argument that transcends what would be expected from their popularity. Being a crossover pop/country hit isn't a shift in the general culture... it's routine. Maybe if she had a crossover deathmetal/ Gospel hit and *brought both audiences together*. But to combine the two best selling genres into one act... again... isn't a change. Kanye is good at what he does. No doubt. But what does he have beyond simply selling records? Simply having a unique flow is completely normal in hip hop. What *change* has he made to the overall musical or cultural conversation? That's the question I keep asking and nobody has been able to come up with an answer that isn't at least equally attributable to somebody else who was doing it before Kanye. \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no *consistent* moral framework\". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.\n\nA few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.\n\nOkay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.\n\nConsider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam\n\nHow can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?\n\nI don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.\n\nAfter giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed.

        "text": "Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  \n\n1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  \n\n2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription\n\n3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.\n\n4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. \n\n5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  \n\nPlease change my view!",
        "argument": "The US will revert to a draft as soon as the US deems it necessary - which is when the number of volunteers do not met the numbers required.\n\nTo counter some of your points, look at this example: World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, [over 10.1 million](https://www.sss.gov/induct.htm) of the US's sixteen million service members were *drafted*\n\nThat's right, WW2, a popular war most people today agree was worth fighting for, drafted over 60% of its servicemembers. Simply put: the US needed manpower, it drafted even when 6 million men volunteered.\n\nKeep in mind too that conscientious objection was an even bigger issue in the past than today. The US was staunchly isolationist up until WW2, and many religious exemptions existed for groups like the Quakers.\n\nIn addition, those servicemembers all served overseas. In fact, Vietnam was similar - the US maintained more troops in West Germany during this time than in Vietnam. Conscripts weren't sent just to fight in Vietnam - many were sent to fill in ranks in Germany to keep our obligations there. \n\nOur obligations worldwide are smaller today, true, but they still exist and may certainly grow again in the future.",

Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.\n\nI do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. \n\nFurthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'\n\nThis is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats.

I still think the comparison holds some validity though, and as I said, I don't think the \"because I told you so\" approach is good, but it's still valid in a way and the child should ultimately respect it just by virtue of the person who is saying it providing for them.\n\n&gt; If you are 18 years old and your parents say take off your hat at the table, they had better be willing to discuss their reasoning at some point. \n\nIt'd be much better if they did, but if they don't, and that's not good enough for you, as I said, you're free to leave. \n\nI fully agree with you that parents should have these conversations with their children, and I hope to be the type of parent one day that will, but I still think that you ultimately have to respect what the person paying for your food and shelter is saying if you're not willing to walk away from that.\n\n&gt; That kind of stuff needs to be taught by parents because the kid won't learn it on his own.\n\nnot entirely. reasoning skills start developing at a certain age, and it's not exclusively about what you are being taught.

An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is \"xe/xer/xerself\" or \"zi/zis/zimself\". My argument is as follows:\n\n1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A \"he\" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.\n2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.\n3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. \n4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Because she was rich and famous she could afford to become society's common definition of a beautiful woman. People could easily mistake her for a biologically birth-born female if they didn't know who she was, and that makes her easier to accept. There are plenty of transwomen and men who can't or won't undergo a transition to make themselves appealing to society's little boxes. Whether its a fear of hormones and surgery, or because of the stress it would cause, or because of the expense, or any personal reason- there's plenty of transgender people who just stay in their own body and just assume the identity they align with. And many of those get accused of \"not really being trans because they don't have the dedication\" to go all the way and fit the definition people have for what qualifies as masculine or feminine. Caitlyn managed because she has the means to assume an identity people can accept. She can pass as the gender she is inside. Do you honestly think people who have been so supportive if Caitlyn's transition went wrong, or she chose to remain looking entirely masculine?

The show, while being very  clever and featuring undoubtedly skilled performers, just does not translate through television. This is where my argument will get a little murky, because I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't translate. It would seem to follow that something that's funny in person would also be funny through television. I just know that when experienced live, improv has such a bigger effect on its audience than when seen on television. \n\nThe show, as a result suffered, ratings began to falter, and it was subsequently cancelled. In the aftermath, redditors began praising the show for its genius, claiming how it was unjustly cancelled, etc, etc, Colin Mochrie, etc. Reddit simply pretends to like it because of its unpopularity and cancellation, because that then elevates that redditor above the general public. \"Normal people just don't 'get it.'

Viscerally, I feel like the two **are** different things and should be treated as such, but every argument I'm seeing seems to fall flat for me and I'm left with the default position: the two are functionally equivalent.\n\nThe primary argument I've read against my view is that there are biological differences between how men and women are wired mentally. However, most of the papers I've read on the matter are based on [population studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011) that tease out group differences from large and varying datasets. Brains aren't monolithic things that are all one way or another - for that matter, new neuronal connections and pathways can be influenced by surroundings, behavior and a host of other factors. If [where you live can determine whether or not you develop schizophrenia](http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/795.full.pdf&amp;), then it's quite possible that growing up with black siblings can subtely affect the brain connections of a white girl from Montana. Stepping back though, why should empirically-observable differences 'legitimize' obvious differences in behavior? Our understanding of brain physiology is nowhere near precise enough to give us a 1:1 correlation between behaviors and biochemistry, and even if it were, it's not clear to me at all that someone's behavior should be invalidated because it doesn't map to our limited biological understanding.\n\nAnother argument I read differentiated gender as an individualistic identity and ethnicity as a group identity. I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing. For every Rachel Dolezal - there are likely thousands of non-black people living in predominantly black neighborhoods, developing identities not terribly different from the black people they most often interact with - your Eminems, to use a terrible example. Saying lack of pigment invalidates that identity seems functionally identical to saying lack of a particular sex-characteristic invalidates a gender identity.\n\nFeel free to point me to a discussion, if you don't want to rehash this.

The current interest is LOW, if not negative in real terms. This means that there arn't sufficient (safe) borrowers to allocate the funds to. Increasing the savings more risks entering a liquidity trap.\n\n2) Stagnation of demand. If you encourage people to save then they arn't spending (obviously). This is probably the worst thing that could happen right now (or in the next few years). \n\n3) Asset price bubbles. With lots of savings being depositied banks will be forced to 'do' something with that money.  Some of the things they will do is buy assets, or lend to buyers of assets: such as Bonds, stocks, property. ect. Rapid increases in the purchase of these has historically lead to their prices becoming speculative. It also prices out of the market the very people who you are teaching should save: Young people. \n\n\nSo thats why  I think encouraging, on mass, a new generation of young people to start savings to that degree would end badly.\n\nI want to understand why others think it shoudl be encouraged so I'm posting here.

For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. \n\nSecondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?\" \n\nIf you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a \"liar,\" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.\n\nSo that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? \n\n**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it? I got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

That may be the case in certain governments, but, for in example Canada, their is tight party control so if a party gets a majority government, they can basically do whatever they want. A detailed plan would be feasible as other parties couldn't do anything to stop a bill from being past and any descent within the party is not tolerated. \n\nIn conclusion it seems your view has been transformed at the very least. You have been shown good reasons as to why a detailed plan should be the route. Your CMV included terms such as the \"right choice\". I ask you, is the \"right\" thing to do everything in your power to get elected, or is it do the responsible right thing for the voters so they can make the most informed decision?\n\nWhat is more \"right\"?",

The international competiton usually consists of a third-party tournament, the IEM World Championship, and two Riot organised events, the Mid Season Invitational and the Riot World Championship (the \"real\" worlds). Of these three only the Riot Worlds is the only really big tournament, with 16 teams and a good playoffs and group stage format.\nMSI features only the best team of each region and the IEM World Championship uses Bo1 groups into Bo3 in the first playoff bracket, which is often criticised as too random for the title.\nThe league structure in all major regions is usually divided into a spring and a summer league with a regular season of 18-40 games or so, followed by playoffs to see determine who the best teams in the region are.\n\nIn the other major eSport titles (Dota, SC2, CSGO) you have \n\n* way more tournaments in general\n\n* way more international competition in general\n\n* more important games, as you have more playoff situation\n\nThis all leads to my opinion that LoL eSports has the most boring circuit, as the majority of the matches that are being played are low impact matches in the regular season and only in domestic competition.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I would appreciate if you help me understand some of the arguments that you apparently think brushed aside.

        "title": "CMV: A system in which students offer \"shares\" of their future earnings is preferable to the current student loan system.",
        "text": "My post is inspired by [this article](http://www.ifyouonlynews.com/politics/chris-christie-suggests-students-sell-themselves-to-investors-to-pay-for-college/) in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell \"shares\" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education.    \n\nI have seen people criticize this system as one of \"indentured servitude\", presumably because for a period of years students could not be released from the requirement to pay a portion of their earnings to the investor(s). \n\nHowever, the current system of student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, amounting to a lifetime obligation anyway (or longer, if they die early and there are co-signers on the loan).  \n\nAdmittedly, fixed-amount loans are better for students who have unexpectedly high earnings -- so this system might discourage some risk-taking.  But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. \n\nA system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. \n\nThis is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs.  Thanks for weighing in!\n\nEdit #1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far.  One delta awarded at this point to /u/PlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree.  (/u/ngxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea.  I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks *should* take a back seat in this arena.)\n\nEdit #2: Whoa!  So many great comments and thoughts.  Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund.  And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts.  Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis.  Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school.   Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work).  Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field.  So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12% of your earnings (above a certain threshold -- see edit #1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3% of your earnings.  \n\nEdit #3:  Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion.  I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to /u/hacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor.  Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system:\n\n* Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks\n* Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically\n* Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system.\n* This deal would be better for some people than for others.  For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal.\n\nEven if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view.  Finally, there has been a lot of discussion premised (and I was guilty of this too, at first) on the notion that your field of study would be a major driver for attracting investors.  I'm coming around to the view that except in the case of very specialized programs (e.g. engineering, medicine), field of study won't be as big a factor as student achievement and quality of school overall. \n\nFrom this point forward, I may not respond to all (or any) further responses, except if I feel they are really adding something new.  Nonetheless, I hope the discussion continues with others participating as desired!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. \n\nHowever, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. \n\nSimply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: \n\n1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\n2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.\n\n3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. \n\n4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\". \n\nAs such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\".

It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\nBut that experience would need to be relevant and established.

Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.\n\nIf that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you \"deferring\" to me costs you nothing.\n\n&gt;Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again.

Something older people generally have more of.\n\n1.  Past experience, not passed.\n\n2.  No, the merit of the argument is the merit of the argument.

Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.\n\n#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.\n\nA really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.\n\n#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.\n\nIf you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything.

THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground.\n\n1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.\n\nOnly The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status.  The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions.\n\n2) They care about more than just themselves.\n\nThe Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales.\n\n3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.\n\nTurkey is key here.  For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.  Now they're wringing their hands about how *powerless* they are to stop ISIS while they gleefully watch the black banner do all their dirty work for them, then step in with overwhelming force to rescue Ataturk's grave the moment it's threatened.  They're bombing Kurdish targets *right now* while crying about ISIS.  I would want independence from them too.\n\n**Things that will not convince me:**\n\n1) A Kurd did something bad once.\n\nEvery group consists of a bulk center and extremes on either end.  It takes a pattern of ideological violence to establish that a group is responsible collectively.  I need to be shown that the Kurds, as a national or cultural entity, are at least half as bad as their neighbors in terms of the actions they will routinely, officially, or systemically commit or tolerate.\n\n2) It is advantageous to ally ourselves with monsters.\n\nLook, you can be totally right about this.

Israel is also another example of a western valued country in the region.\n\n&gt;2) They care about more than just themselves.\n\n\nI feel that this part is based on an incredibly....optimistic view of the Kurds.\n\nKurdish middlemen, including Kurdish political leaders are quite willing to work with ISIS when there's material gains involved. See their involvement with helping ISIS to sell oil for instance:\n\nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c269c4e-5ace-11e4-b449-00144feab7de.html#axzz3hJfQSOhy\n\nEvery single political group in the Middle-East are largely motivated by material gains. Even incredibly ideological groups have bottom lines. The Kurds are fighting ISIS because they are a threat to Kurdistan, if ISIS wasn't a threat to the Kurds, the Kurds wouldn't fight them even if they are committing genocide.\n\n&gt;3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.\n\nTurkey isn't even too different from the US in the 1980s in this regard, who cooperated with Islamic extremists to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. \n\nPeople are primarily motivated by realistic geopolitics in the region. It's awfully problematic to attribute actions to \"morals\" or ideology when there are so many strange bedfellows if you look at ideology. \n\nSyria for instance is allied with Iran despite Syria being a nominally secular, atheistic state and Iran is a theocracy. \n\nSaudi Arabia, the most Islamist country in the region and Egypt are also close despite the fact that the current dictator (let's just admit it) of Egypt came to power on the promise that he will save the country from the Islamists. \n\nIsrael, a western, Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, a country which don't allow Jews into the country, have a defacto alliance against Iran.

        "title": "CMV: Vulcans are superior to Humans",
        "text": "Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable for the organization to be based out of San Francisco, where the 4 founding races formed the coalition of planets, but with 150 member planets spread over 8,000 light years, why is so much of the leadership human?\n\nThis isn't a superficial skin-color thing, we're dealing with marked biological differences between the races. Vulcans, despite their violent past, have achieved \"superhuman\" levels of mastery over their emotions, allowing them to become excellent administrators and politicians, and even if we were to assume that Humans and Vulcans have the same fundamental capacity for intelligence, Vulcan discipline gives them supreme focus to produce an inordinate concentration of highly educated citizens. Even in sheer physical prowess, Vulcans massively outclass Humans, \"Take me out to the Holosuite\" being an excellent example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Out_to_the_Holosuite\n\nHere, the Vulcans are shown to be physically far superior, DOMINATING the mixed-race (human dominant) crew fielded by the Human Captain, in a human sport, with a final score of 10-1. Nevertheless the crew of DS9 celebrate their single point as a victory of human will rather than learning from the experience that Vulcans are superior in so many ways. \n\nVulcans are known for logic, they take great efforts to avoid letting their emotions cloud their judgement. We all know of a prestigious Human starship captain for ignoring the odds in a situation and taking great risks over the protests of his even-keeled Vulcan officer. It's convenient that luck favored the crew so often after these brash and illogical decisions. These apparent \"successes\" for making the wrong decision only served to stroke this captain's ego and belief that his \"gut instincts\" are what qualify him to lead. How is this different from a foolish business executive making random decisions and claiming credit for successes, and blaming other factors for failures? The meritorious act is in the decision itself, not in the outcome. To judge the brash decision based on a fortunate outcome is a flawed post hoc reasoning, akin to throwing a dart, sliding a dartboard under it, and claiming an excellent throw! What if even a few of those risks resulted in the *likely* outcome where many if not all of the crew members were killed because the captain ignored the logical choice in favor of an unsupported gut decision? \n\nIf there are any flaws to be noted in the Vulcan people as a whole, it would be low birth-rates, a bias towards peace, and a relative lack of ego(despite whatever projections humans perceive in a Vulcan's taciturn face). Perhaps humans have seized so much power as a direct result of greed, ambition, and nepotism, allowing them to promote humans above more qualified non-human members of Starfleet? Nevertheless, it seems clear that Vulcans are superior to humans.\n\n(The tone's intentionally a bit tongue and cheek to make this discussion more fun, but the fiction really does seem to over-exalt humans in the Federation)",
        "argument": "Vulcans are individually strong and smart... and after 200 years they couldn't even comprehensively end a conflict with the Andorians. They had massively better technology than others in the area and the Tellarites were natural allies since they also hated the Andorians but the Vulcans still couldn't get their act together and calm things down.\n\nThe problem is, because they are so individually superior and logical, they have trouble interacting with other races and different stories go back and forth on whether they are arrogant or just seem that way to everyone else, though neither is a good trait for working with other (as you see in the above example of conflict). This is remarked upon as one of humanities greatest traits (Babel One, These are the Voyages...)\n\nFurther, they are so inherently emotional they have to completely suppress it to not murder each other. This means they can't trust their intuition or the like, and so cannot take advantage of the brains inherent ability to figure things out on a subconcious level.\n\nFinally, you can say humans are so successful from greed. However, after the Third World War, the [New World Economy](http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/New_World_Economy) replace possessions and wealth as primary human pursuits for self-enrichment and the betterment of humanity. One can argue there is still \"greed,\" greed for social acclaim by accomplishment, but I would say that is good! They have turned a negative fact into a positive, and are now on the forefront of exploration of the galaxy, diplomacy, and defense of the Federation (one of the few \"not jerk\" governments encountered). \n\nEven if Vulcans are better at baseball.

To be honest though, I don't think I'll come back here again. I wanted to have a discussion, and it was nice to talk with some of you, but I don't have enough comment karma to spare for all the downvotes I got when responding to comments. That seems to be a theme in most posts in this sub. \n\nLike I said, I appreciate all the responses, and a big thanks to those who took the time to respond to me and add sources and information to back up their reasoning.*\n\nI'm really struggling with this one, CMV. This is my first post here. Reading through threads concerning this issue here on Reddit has made me wonder if I'm just a heartless jackass or not since it appears most of Reddit goes against the grain with me on this issue here. \n\nI don't feel like it's wrong to drug test welfare recipients. I agree somewhat with the view that if I am required to pass a drug test to even have a shot at a job, a welfare recipient should have to do the same to receive assistance which they're not required to work for. I've heard that a 30 day rehabilitation option is offered in some states for people who test positive, and benefits are cut off for those who refuse that option. I don't agree with punishing someone for addiction and not offering help, but if the drug testing states implemented this policy, I don't think I'd see any problems with it at all. \n\nI feel this way because I've been in a lot of situations where this has been a relevant issue. Cashiering for a small town grocery store growing up, knowing the people using food stamps at the counter, and also knowing that the majority if them are using drugs (small town) helped me form an opinion early on. I didn't think it was fair that at 16, my tax money was being used to help someone pay for food when they spent their money on drugs. If they wanted food, why not by it instead of drugs? Of course, now that I'm older I realize that not everything is so black and white, and that this goes deeper than my 16 year old opinion. \n\nI'm a home health nurse that works with pediatric patients in their homes. My patients are almost always in very poor, run down neighborhoods. All of these families are on food stamps and government assistance (my nursing contract is paid through their Medicaid) and literally, out of the last 10 families I've worked with, 4 of the parents used some kind of drug in front of me, and at least 3 more parents were very obviously using drugs. I'm not counting alcohol or tobacco use either, just what's actually being tested for. \n\nI have compassion and empathy for people, and I'm very left-leaning on most issues. I'm 100% for human rights, and I try to imagine myself in other's shoes before forming an opinion, but this is something that I just don't see a problem with, especially if rehabilitation is an offered option. I've also struggled with my own habits and addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I realize not all people are the same, but any time I've needed a job badly enough, I've been able to kick the weed and nicotine long enough to pass a pre employment screening. I feel like that's my responsibility, and that plays into why I've formed the opinion that I have.\n\nSo help me out, CMV. Change my view.\n\nEdit: I should also probably note that I understand the low statistics on how many people actually do end up popping positive in these tests, and I realize that it's costing a lot of tax money to do so. I don't think it's a waste of tax payer money if these people are being offered an option to be rehabilitated. ",
        "argument": "The main reason I am against drug testing welfare recipients is because to me it violates the 4th ammendment which protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. I fall on the side that because you need welfare is not a good enough reason to be subject to a search of drug use through a drug test. It is a tough moral issue either way though. You also need to remember that it isn't difficult to cheat on a drug test and that many of these people aren't actually using drugs. There will always be a percentage that takes advantage of welfare but it is usually small. By drug testing it does end up costing the taxpayer more and doesn't really resolve the issue of getting these people off drugs and into a lifestyle they can be successful in.

However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death.

Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control.

        "text": "I can think of no reason to set such prices other than as a psychological trick to make something seem cheaper than it is.\n\nThe consumer gains little to nothing by buying the product for 1 cent cheaper. It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise.\n\nI would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the $599.99 store than the $600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary .99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition.\n\nTherefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned.\n\nI can see how that might cause problems with prices like $19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference.\n\nIf you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott.\n\nAnd if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale.\n\nYou would probably change my view if you present a convincing central reason for stores to do this that isn't purely manipulative.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "text": "I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. \n\nFirst, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. \n\nIt's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   \n\nThe cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.\n\nThen there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. \n\nI can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. \n\nTL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV. \n\n\nEdit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 \"hurr Florida has bad things about it too.\" I definitely know that's true!\n\nEdit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about \"Boston &gt; NYC\"; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY. \n\nEdit 3: For everyone who keeps bitching at me about the delta I gave to u/whattodo-whattodo - READ THE FUCKING RULES. Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: \"Please note that a delta is not a sign of 'defeat', *it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion*. A delta =/= end of discussion\" (emphasis added). I've gotten so many replies to the effect of \"hurr, you're a law student and you gave up dat easy?\" Those people can choke on a phallus; I'm just giving credit where it's due, per the rules.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In fact, some of us are quite good-looking and take pride in our hygiene. \n\n&gt; The cost of living is exorbitant.\n\nSalaries are adjusted to the cost of living, to some small degree. But you're probably still thinking of Manhattan (and some trendy parts of Brooklyn). When you go out into the outer boroughs, rent can easily go down to 700/600/500 per month, which isn't terrible. When you weigh the cost of living in a small space to the availability of basically everything (i.e. food, nightlife, cultural institutions, people, schools, etc.), then I would say lots of people would give up a front yard to live in a place of diversity and activity.\n\n&gt; Winters are frigid and soul-crushing.\n\nThis is undeniably true.

Most people I have ever taken a foreign language class with resented being there and putting in years of effort to learn a skill they might only use a couple times in their whole life, and will likely forget.\n\nObviously people in some careers, like diplomats or aid workers, need to learn another language, but I just don't see how the average person will spend enough time with people who don't speak their language, in a place without an interpreter or internet access, to justify the amount of time spent learning a language.\n\n*I am excepting English from this because so much of the Internet is available only in English.\n\n**Edit**: /u/RustyRook changed my view by linking a study which showed that learning a language could delay onset of dementia by 4.5 years.

While it may not be as \"worth it\" for someone who has no intentions to ever travel to another country to learn a new language, if you do any international travel, just trying to speak the native language, even if you butcher it, is appreciated by the native people. Just think, if a foreign person came to your town and started to talk to you in broken English, would you be mad that they didn't take the time to fully learn your language? Or would you be appreciative that they are even trying and help them with what they're asking? Now, extend that to someone with a phone out in front of them.

        "argument": "Frivolousness (the actual legal term) is a really high bar. \n\nThere are two types, factual and legal frivolousness.  For factual frivolousness the Supreme Court [has held the standard to be as follows.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9141408508548092395)\n\n&gt;[A] court may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are \"clearly baseless,\" 490 U.

The facts alleged were that the plaintiff was burned (true) by coffee that was hot (true), that was above industry temperature standards (a plausible assertion of fact), and that McDonald's willfully made its coffee hotter than standard (a plausible assertion of fact).\n\nAs far as legal frivolousness, this is defined [as follows:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=868429855339617087&amp;q=legal+merit+frivolous&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33)\n\n&gt;an appeal on a matter of law is frivolous where none of the legal points are arguable on their merits.\n\nIn this case, there was at least a plausible case for tort negligence based on the alleged facts.

Socialism was always something my parents believed was for excessively liberal areas, like Canada and Cali; though they were very forward-thinking regarding social issues, such as homosexuality, recreational drug use, and foreign disputes. I love Sanders' social policy, but I can't see his economics winning many republicans or libertarians over. CMV?",
        "argument": "What spending do you feel is unnecessary? \n\nHere is a pie chart of all discresionary spending (2009 data):\n\nhttp://dissidentvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/3-Discretionary-Budget-2009.jpg\n\nHere is all spending (2012):\n\nhttp://climbingthefinancialmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Federal-Spending-2012.png\n\nSo where are you cutting? \n\nWelfare and entitlement is a popular place. However, keep in mind that for every welfare dollar spent, the government collects somewhere over $0.60 in tax revenue. People who get welfare spend the money immediately in the economy, and that generates a lot of economic activity. So it's very difficult to actually close a budget by cutting safety-net programs.\n\nNext up is Social Security and Medicare. These programs are funded through FICA taxes. They would both be fine if for some reason we didn't exempt all income over $118,500 from FICA taxes. Even with no changes, Social Security could continue to pay out 75% of current benefits forever. Meanwhile, CMS and medicare does all the actual hard work in health care. They establish the billing codes, decides what is reimbursed at what rate, etc. All the private insurers basically say \"we pay what medicare pays\" for everything. They do this while running a 3% overhead. For the purpose of comparison, private health insurers run 20-25% overhead. Any shift of healthcare from CMS to the private industry would me a massive loss of efficiency. Again, you can but things, but that doesn't mean you actually help yourself out in the long run.\n\nYou can rail against the US Dept of Education or the EPA, but the reality is that completely eliminating these programs are 1. not going to close the budget deficit, and 2. incur substantial societal costs.\n\nConservatives seem to see taxation and spending as inherently bad the for economy. This is simply not accurate. Money gathered by the government is injected right back into the economy. Money \"wasted\" on bureaucrats is money that is paid, as a salary, to consumers who then go out and use it to buy goods and services. This is why European countries are able to sustain tax rates that are significantly higher than the US and still have strong economic growth. Taxes are not bad as long as long as they are spent back into the economy. Here is a graph of GPD per capita:\n\nhttp://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/real-gdp-per-capita.png\n\nAs you can see, there is not a huge difference in economic growth rate between the US and Europe, despite the differences in taxation and spending policies.\n\nIn regards to the defecit, debt for governments is different than consumer debt. The first major difference is the interest rate. The US government is currently paying 2.13% interest on 10 year loans. That's basically equal to expected inflation over that period; in other words the US is borrowing money for free right now. Because it is seen as a 100% safe place to stash money, people are willing to give it to us to hold onto for a while. It is also denominated in US dollars. Conveniently, the US government is responsible for printing US dollars. It could literally print the money to pay off it's debts at any time. Printing money causes inflation, so the US government doesn't do this, but it could. The only way we could possibly default on our debt is through deliberate political action on the part of our government. It's like Debt is a room full of shit, except you make the shit, and you decide how much gets shoveled out every day. You have to control the level of the debt, but as long as you keep it stable over the long run it's not a terrible thing. In fact, when Clinton was president there was a lot of concern that the US government was going to pay off it's debts and there would be no more T-Bills. This caused a lot of anxiety among investors as they depend on treasuries to balance their risk.",

To counter people will bring up the \"bathroom lock\" analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong.\n\nMy problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of \"government back doors\". Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole. This is put in place with safety in mind - if something happens to you while you're in the bathroom someone can get in and save you without breaking down the door. I don't know about you, but this is something that comforts me.\n\nIn the same way that no one wants to see me shit and would only actually use this \"backdoor\" through the bathroom lock in emergencies, the government doesn't care about my email to my mom about my sisters birthday, and only actually use collected data when it might be of some help fighting terrorism.\n\n\nWhen I noticed this I couldn't think about any reason why what I have said above is wrong, so please, CMV.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a \"master\" at some skill or aspect of your life.  \n\nWhat I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few \"trades\".\n\nFor starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.  \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is \"success\" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.   \n\nA Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is \"good\" at many things and a Master is \"great\" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.   \n\nI try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.  \n\nPlease don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.\n\nI am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.         \n\n**Edit** \nHere is the delta, thanks **AnecdotallyExtant**\n\n&gt;I will change your view with a single diagram.\nIt will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all.\nAs an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house -- nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid.\nSo again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity.\nWhich means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all.\n\nPlease read below if you want to see the diagram.  Many others had the same argument, but you approached it from an angle that makes sense.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "text": "**Some Definitions**\n\n**Islamism** - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or \"caliphate\") or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism).\n\n**Islam** - Religion with 1 billion followers worldwide. Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). \n\n**Sheik** - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinions/rulings, known as *fatwas.*\n\n\n\nMy case is this.\n\n* **Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK.**\nThe emergence of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country.\n\n* **A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance.**\nIslam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this.\n\n* **A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism** - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers.\n\nMy solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. \n\n**TL;DR** - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World. It answers a lot of the current political problems in Muslim countries and would help establish Islam as the progressive force I believe it has always been, rather than the regressive and conservative force people fear it to be. \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "The idea of a single, normative Islam is not a helpful construction to someone on the outside who wishes to treat Islam academically. Typically, all we require is self-identification as Muslim, and then the person defines _his_ Islam.\n\nWe try not to sign off on particular versions as authentic or real, and instead try to present the history, the branches, etc. Islamism finds itself on the tree of Islam when Islam is treated academically, and the idea that we couldn't somehow trace it back to the roots, that it would clearly be shown to be inauthentic, seems implausible.\n\nIf it's really to be treated academically, the message will be chaos. I'd like to compare it to my first steps into studying Christianity academically. I had a single view of Christianity in mind and believed that it was essentially straightforward, although there were minor wobbles. Catholics killed lots, Martin Luther saved us, and then America.\n\nI reacted in horror when I finally dug into Christianity academically. Not only were there Catholics, but there were Orthodox. And people who didn't think Jesus was God. And unitarians. And universalists. There were churches in Ethiopia and there were monophysites and diopho-whatevers. There were Chinese Christians who had some pretty weird views. Ebionites, which sounded racist. And God knows what relationship God, the Jews, and Christians are supposed to have.\n\nIt was chaos. An academic study of a religion rarely reveals a single, pure source. This is true in Islam too - few generations after the Prophet, the ummah is already split. And today it still is. Not just Sunni/Shia. There are also Ahmaddiya/Qadiani, who to outsiders are indistinguishible. There are four major schools of fiqh. And maybe this is the isnad for the use of the miswak during fasting, or maybe it's a pile of spaghetti.\n\n... and all of this plays directly into the hands of the Islamist. The average person will recoil from all the choice he's just been presented. All the Islamist has to do is present his purified, simple version, and he's saved the day. The average person does not want, cannot tolerate, cannot sustain so much complexity. The Islamist message is appealing _because_ it gives straightforward, unambiguous answers that do not require three pages of footnotes, even if they're wrong.\n\nYou want thinkers, but you cannot turn your average person into a \"thinker.\" This is not an insult - I've taught hundreds of good people, many of whom nevertheless fail to master any significant level of critical thinking. I know that most people fail not because of capacity, but because their environment does not afford them the sort of leisure they need. They have families. They have jobs.\n\nBesides, the West coming in to teach the Muslim world its faith... the audacity of the idea is breathtaking. Even if we were best positioned to do it, we'd hardly be the best positioned to do it. The backlash would probably invalidate the entire project.\n\nI'm not saying it wouldn't help for the average Muslim to know more about his religion. Any bit of extra knowledge anywhere would help. But simply because #1) military interventions haven't worked and #2) an educated populace would be nice, doesn't mean this is a workable solution.",

        "text": "Adult tickets cost more than child's tickets for anything that distinguishes the two and often this makes sense. Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly \"niche\" category of movies. \n\nI think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies. It seems like the only \"right\" they've acquired is to technically see a PG-13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase. I know that thirteen is not universal but I find it wrong to charge adult prices for anyone under eighteen (you could maybe argue seventeen since they can see rated R movies and can work).\n\nPlease leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.

        "argument": "There are three justifications for the price differences for children under 13. \n\nFirst, teenagers and young adults attend the movies more often than any other demographic. That group is over represented - People from 12-18 represent only 8% of the population but represent 16% of the movie going audience and 18 to 24 year olds represent 19% of the audience but just 10% of the population.  However, children under 12 are underrepresented - they make up just 7% of the typical movie going audience while being 14% of the population. (By the way, these stats are from 2010 since I couldn't find anything more recent).  The only other group that is significantly underrepresented are seniors. \nSo the theater industry offers discounts to those underrepresented groups needs to incentivize them to attend. Thus, we regularly see discounts for senior &amp; children 12 and under at movie theaters.   However, since teenagers are showing up in numbers already, it doesn't make sense to target them with a discount. You want them paying full price.  \n\nSecond , as was mentioned above, is that a lower child price targets families. It's essentially making attending the movies as a family less expensive and thus more attractive option.  Other groups - a pack of teenagers for example - are less likely to consider the total cost for the group since they will be paying for their tickets individually. However,  families are going to be very aware of the total cost since they will not be paying individually.  And, they will be comparing that total cost against other entertainment options. So a teenager might be asking \"is it worth $15 bucks to see this movie with my friends\" while a family of four  is asking \"is $60 worth it to see this movie.\"  Once you start considering that total cost, it may not sound like much of s value. So, theaters improving that value proposition with a discount makes sense. \n\nFinally, I'd argue that in general the younger a person is, the less they get out of a movie. Now, that's not true for all movies. But, if a parent is considering attending let's say a typical drama, I think you would conclude that your 11 year old might not appreciate or understand that movie well enough to justify the $15 a full priced ticket will cost.  That is not to say the child won't get any enjoyment out of that movie, but a lower price might convince a parent to bring a child that they wouldn't for full price. Also, and I think more importantly, that parent might not attend that movie unless they can take their child (think single or stay at home parents, or just those unwilling to attend the movies without their children).  Now, like a said, I don't think this is true for every movie, but for certain movies a discounted child ticket price can be justified by young children being less able to appreciate those movies. \n\n\n ",

        "text": "To me growth of economy is a meaningless statistic. Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in their personal life based on this kind of statistic? For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy: low skill job and doing things yourself means you won't be buying blueberries from other people. Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market.\n\nOne could do that, yes, but I find it laughable how this is the priority goal for politicians - not health, literacy, justice, equality or some other virtue. When asked why economy should grow, they give contrived reasoning from dynamics of economy. They ignore that economy seems to work in cyclic process of growth and decline. Tragicomically many are ready to *worsen* living conditions of masses to accelerate economic growth. What is the point in all this? How can someone strongly support economic growth while having no interest in either means or results of it?",
        "argument": "&gt; Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange.\n\nThe economy also includes the exchange goods *and services*, not goods alone. So lawyers, doctos, yoga instructors all exchange their services for goods and services from others.\n\n&gt;  For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy\n\nWhat do you mean by this exactly? It may not require too much skill, but it's hard work and does require speed and attention to detail while picking the blueberries.\n\n&gt; Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market.\n\nNo, it does not. Organic food is more expensive than its substitutes. As for the electronics, no one recommends replacing a phone year after year. People choose to eat junk, and buy replaceable products. The money that people save by not spending on electronics goes to other goods and services. Even if it goes in the bank, it's put into the system and made available to investors.\n\nBy the way, politicians make a HUGE deal of education. Every single campaign makes education of the cornerstones of their campaigns because it appeals to so many voters. And the same goes for healthcare. ",

I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.\n\nHowever, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. \n\nIt bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.\n\nI've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.\n\nAny comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.",
        "argument": "WARNING Princess Mononoke Spoilers ahead!!!\n\nWhich films have you watched? I would say my two favorites are Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. With all of their films you have to first accept the fantastical world in which they live. There are ghosts, creatures, and spells. I'll try and give you a run down for what I love about Mononoke aside from the music and artwork (which I agree, are fantastic). I was going to do both but this one ended up long enough.\n\nPrincess Mononoke is a real out and out fantasty/action movie. It has very strong environmental themes, anti-war themes, and a number of wonderfully grey characters. Aside from Ashitaka everyone is flawed, proud, and stuck thinking that their way is the only way. No character is all evil or all good. There are strong women and men and each side truly believes in its cause.\n\nThe entire opening sequence is excellent. Ashitaka, the prince of a hidden and ancient people, spies something huge and evil coming towards his town. Him and his badass elk Yakul chase the thing down and kill it before it can harm the village but at his own sacrifice. He must leave and try and find a cure to the evil the beast poisoned him with. That evil (stemming from a bullet) is at the base of this movie. All at once it causes great suffering, but it also gives Ashitaka power and strength.\n\nThere follows a long excellent journey where he meets various people. It all culminates in the boars' suicide attack and the attempted killing of the forest god, a creature that is perfectly loved and serene. I don't know if you've watched this movie, but every time this scene comes around it affects me. It comes down to a war between nature and industry and as the heroes of nature and torn down in their folly you can feel how it affects many of the characters involved. This got a bit rambly and I have to run, might look it back over later.\n\nAs a quick note Spirited Away has a number of big themes as well as being a great film for children and adults (like the Pixar greats) and a stellar and compelling main character. Is it number 10 of all time like the list today on /r/movies put it? I don't know. But I do think they're both excellent.",

I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly:\n\n1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90%) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in.\n\n2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner.\n\n3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with #1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form.\n\nI think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "text": "Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or in the process of mandating a minimum wage of ~$15/hour. While on the surface, this seems like a good policy for strengthening the poor/middle class I believe this will ultimately HURT, not help the public, and especially the poor. \n\nHere are several common arguments made in favour of the raising minimum wage and my response:\n\n* \"Average wages haven't increased despite an increase in production and profit in the economy\"\n\nIt's a common misunderstanding that wages are/should be directly tied to production. In reality wages are determined just like prices of anything else, through supply and demand. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled and easily replaceable (through either humans or automation) making the supply of labour far larger than the demand, which equals a lower wage. The rise in technology that has resulted in higher production from labour has little affect on wages. \n\n* \"Current minimum wages are so low that they do not pay a livable annual salary, keeping the working poor in a perpetual state of poverty\"\n\nI would challenge the idea that most minimum wage jobs were ever meant to be sustainable for living. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled labour (ex. factory work, assembly lines) or service industry jobs (cooks, janitorial staff, retail jobs etc..). At least to me, these seem like temporary work done by people in the process of finding higher paying employment (students, recent graduates, new immigrants etc...), and not intended as a career at all, so a livable wage is not required. \n\n* \"A higher minimum wage would increase the income of many in the population, boosting spending, saving and the overall economy.\"\n\nAs I said previously, the vast majority of minimum wage jobs are easily replaceable, outsourced or automated. If large companies are forced by government to pay high minimum wages, they will seek cheaper alternatives and replacements instead. For example, a McDonald's hamburger could very easily be made faster, cheaper, cleaner and better by a machine, [like this one, which makes a burger every 10 seconds ](http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-burger-robot-2014-8). If the minimum wage gets high enough that it costs McDonald's more to pay 10 people to flip burgers than one machine, they will simply replace the human labour altogether. This will result in an increase in unemployment. So while those who retain their minimum wage jobs will be better off, many will simply be replaced, leaving the unemployed workers in a WORSE position than before. \n\nHere are some things that would change my view: \n\n* Research evidence that demonstrates positive impact from countries/states that have already raised minimum wage\n\n* A justification that the minimum wage must be a \"living wage\"\n\n* Evidence that a wage increase would not result in the loss of unskilled jobs to outsourcing, automation etc...\n\n* Any other reasonable justification of minimum wage\n\n\nPlease change my view!\n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.\n\nFood: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.\n\nDiversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. \n\nJuice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool.\n\nPop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called \"Navels\" or \"Valencia\" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, \"life is like a crate of apples...\" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety. Lastly, there's no Johnny Orangeseed, check and mate.\n\nLove to hear orange fans change my mind though, let's see it.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "A few pros for oranges:\n\n- Easier to travel with. Throw an orange into a dirty bag, the part you eat stays clean. Don't have a plate to put it on? The peel suffices.\n\n- An orange is cleaner to eat. Both because of the peel, and because it naturally segments. Very hard to eat an apple without getting sticky juice all over you. I hate the feeling of sticky face and hands after eating an apple.\n\n- Hard to make an argument about taste as preferences differ, but personally I find apples pretty boring. Citrus is more interesting to me.\n\nTo a few of your points:\n\n&gt; Alcohol\n\nNot really a pro for apples themselves. There are also orange liqueurs. I'd say that apples are used for alcohol more for convenience historically, and now tradition, rather than any inherent advantage. Somewhere in Africa there is liquor made by the tribe's women all chewing up some plant matter and spitting it into a big pot to ferment (really, I swear, I saw it on an odd food show). That's not really a benefit to spit.\n\n&gt; Food\n\nAn orange pie seems possible, it's just that other citrus works slightly better for it (key lime pie...) \n\n&gt; Diversity\n\nPerhaps the original form of the orange is better to begin with, so there's less need to create many variations. Also, if wide variations are allowed, I'd get to include many other types of citrus as benefits to oranges. A lemon, lime, grapefruit, pomelo etc are likely about as similar to oranges as the many breeds of apples are to each other, right? (cue biologist to tell me how wrong we are)\n\n&gt; Pop culture\n\nApple benefited from a recognizable icon, but given their neat technology, probably could have been just as successful as \"orange.\" Unfortunately that wouldn't roll off the tongue quite so well, and the Macintosh pun would be lost...

        "text": "This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  \n\nMy wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  \n\nI hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    \n\nTL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  \n\nEdit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  \n\nEdit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  \n\nEdit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:\n\n1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  \n2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  \n3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   \n4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited\n5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  \n",
        "argument": "&gt; I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.\n\nIn case of blacks, isn't that sort of begging the question of where that culture *came from*? \n\nEven if for latinos, you would subscribe for a theory about their countries' catholicism being weaker than protestant work ethic, that would be one thing. \n\nBut how do you argue, that if you kidnap millions of people, keep them as cattle  for generations, forbid them to learn literacy, and break apart their families at will, then for another century, regularly lynch them, force them to live in specific districts, and occasionally firebomb the most successful of those districts, then the resulting ghetto culture somehow won't be primarily and obviously shaped by racism?

        "title": "CMV: Women being underrepresented is not a real problem.",
        "text": "Hi.\n\nWhenever I read about people trying to \n\n- increase the number of women in science or engineering\n- increase the number of women in politics\n- increase the number of women in positions of power\n- increase the number of women that are firefighters or police\n\nI can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve.\n\nThe current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: \n\n- gender-specific student grants, \n- positions reserved for women, \n- lower physical requirements,\n- etc.\n\nAs I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways:\n\n- They involve so-called \"positive discrimination\", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.\n\n- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. \n\nThe only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.\n\nReddit, change my view!\n\nPD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. \n\nEDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that:\n\n- Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less \"threatening\" to other women.\n- Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination.\n- Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it.\n\nI remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters, ...) would also benefit from having more women. \n\nSome of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are:\n\n/u/Yxoque: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csompka\n\n/u/waldrop02: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csosztz\n\n/u/clairebones: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csorp8q\n\n/u/yes_thats_right:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csoy213\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But I'll tell you one thing, I have never failed to comply with an officers orders.\n\nI nearly ever incident of a person involved in a police shooting, they have one problem.  They are not being compliant.  The United States offers you rights, but your rights can't keep you alive.  This often turns into a matter of \"you're victim blaming.\"  I'm simply saying that right or wrong, the behavior of these victims can most often be described as \"exercising outrageously poor judgement.\" \n\nFor one simple reason, I value my life. It's not a matter of principle, it's a matter of practicality.  I don't want to die. And I don't feel sorry for anyone whose ego is bigger than their brain, whether or not their shooting was justified.  \n\nCMV",
        "argument": "It seems like you're under the impression that sympathizers believe these victims did nothing wrong. But that's not what they're saying. They're saying the reaction to what the victims did wrong was radically disproportionate, and that if the same scenario occurred with a white person it would have ended differently. \n\nLet's think of this in terms of three tiers: 1) punishment for the original crime; 2) punishment for resisting arrest or otherwise compounding the original crime; 3) straight up killing the person. Nobody is arguing (well, *most* people are not arguing) against #s 1 or 2. They are arguing against #3 exclusively. There's an acknowledgment that these men did something wrong, and then something wronger, but that neither of those justifies getting shot. For example, Garner earned #1 for selling loose cigarettes, and #2 for swatting away the officer trying to handcuff him (even this is debatable, but I'll let it go for the sake of the bigger issue). But #3 shouldn't have even been on the table. The maneuver used on him wasn't authorized; he didn't need five different officers swarming him. That's the part people are mad about. No one thinks he should have just gotten off entirely. \n\nIs it a practical reality that they might have avoided death by being entirely submissive? Probably, sure. But most people aren't arguing against that either. Instead, they're arguing that 1) Changes need to be made to alter that practical reality and 2) An altogether *different* practical reality exists for white people. You say that it's not a matter of principle, but the debate you're watching *is* one primarily concerned with principle, as a means to effect a change in practical necessities down the road. Don't think for a second that the black community is somehow unaware of the best practices in dealing with the police, or surprised at what these actions bring on. What we're seeing is just cases where people get particularly scared, or frustrated, or whatever. And sure, their reactions are mistakes, both legally and practically. But they're very, very minor mistakes compared to people who earn their death, like a hostage taker or a mass shooter. \n\nTL;DR — Having sympathy is distinct from expecting exoneration. You can both acknowledge their wrongdoing and be angry at how their wrongdoing was handled, which is what most people are doing. This controversy is mainly dealing in principle, whether or not principle is important to you. Everyone is already aware of what should be done practically; they're protesting that necessity itself, and calling for policy changes that would alter it. ",

        "argument": "In principle, I agree with you that parents do not simply deserve unconditional respect just by virtue of being their parents. But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.\n\nFirst of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.\n\nIn the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where \"because I said so\" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.\n\nIf your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.\n\nAlso, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying \"because I said so\" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. \n\nWith your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever. You need to get on with your life at some point. ",

Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.\n\n\nAs I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.\n\n\nI can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. \n\n\nHowever, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.\n\n\nI sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.\n\n\nIgnorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).\n\n\nSo to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message.

How does the human brain work, and what are the factors that have caused them to behave this way. Try and think about things that you are resistant to change, or hesitate doing. Whether its watching a television show or movie that a friend recommended but doesn't look like something you'd like, or a political belief you hold strongly. Think about if physical violence would have an effect on you and would actually affect any of those feelings, possibly change them, or maybe reinforce them. \n\n\nThink about how your feelings about these things have changed over time. Think about yourself 5 years ago and what was important to you(or if you're younger, 2-3 years). Have you changed your views on things? What factors changed them?\n\n\nLastly, I'll relate this to your specific issue. Yesterday my Fiancé made a list of curse words to rank their severity to us(we do weird things apparently), One that came up as a topic of discussion was the word \"Faggot\". Both of us felt it held a similar level of severity to \"Nigger\", but we talked about how even just 5 years ago, it was pretty common and didn't bother either of us that much when we heard it, both of us remembering close friends who used it frequently and weren't uncomfortable with it. Now, both of us feel we would stand up and be upset with someone who used the word \"Faggot\" to describe a homosexual, and that's a clear example of a huge cultural shift. This shift did not happen with violence being the driving force, but I would argue education and exposure helped people empathize. When people started realizing that their friend, who they knew and liked was actually gay, they start to see that it's not really a difference that needs to divide us.\n\n\nThe best way to change peoples minds would be to talk to them, show them that you are human, that you're not different from them.

The fact is, it is outdated.\n\nI believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV\n\n---Edit---\nMany responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.\n\nTo CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV\n\n(also, deltas incoming for added info on the topic.

        "text": "What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy the idea undermines, and they have no bearing on truth, which should be the only thing that determines the believability of an idea.\n\nHere is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes. I should believe this idea because evidence supports it, and not be afraid of the power dynamics it may disrupt. That is *intellectual integrity*.\n",
        "argument": "Suppose an old man lies on his deathbed, and you are his estranged son. As he lies dying, he apologizes for the issue that has caused a rift between you, and asks for your forgiveness. No matter what he says, though, you can't really find it in your heart to give it to him. So do you lie and tell him you forgive him, or do you tell him the truth and make his final moments painful?\n\nConsider another situation. The prime minister of a nation is the best they have every seen. Under his leadership, the wealth gap between the rich and the poor has decreased; democracy has flourished from the ruins of the previous dictatorship; GDP has increased dramatically, and foreign investments are pouring in. You are his secretary, and one day you accidentally walk in on him having sex with another man, who you recognize as another member of the government he has close ties with. The people in your country are socially conservative, and the knowledge that he has sex with men and is cheating on his wife would ruin him. One day, a reporter comes up to and says that she has suspicions of just this. Do you answer her honestly?\n\nI think it's naive to say truth is the *only* thing that every matters about a statement. Honesty is a good policy because we cannot function without trust. But truth functions as a weapon just as much as misinformation. It is a true fact that black people have lower IQs than white people. Stating this fact without context (the fact that IQ correlates with environment and social class, the subsequent discussion about why African Americans tend to be in a lower social class due to the effects of American history and why this is almost certainly not genetic, the fact that IQ tests are biased in favor of the life experiences of the writers, the fact that a reverse Pygmalion effect exists racially, the fact that race as we use it is a social construct and that generalizations over race are basically meaningless the way most people use them, and so on) ends up having a sociopolitical effect anyway. Rather than explain why the fact does not imply what most people think it implies, I would rather not state the fact in the first place because facts don't exist in a vacuum. I wouldn't lie about it- but I wouldn't bring it up unless I knew my audience would understand it correctly.\n\nThe truth is important. The problem is that the truth is wrapped up in a web of theory, and the wrong truths to the wrong theories will lead to people holding harmful views. ",

I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.\n\nBoring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.\n\nThe NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line.

I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. \n\n     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.\n\nEdit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.\n\nEdit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.\n\nEdit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "My answer will be from the perspective of a university student in the UK, so it might not apply directly to the US.\n\nLow numbers of right-leaning students and faculty at universities is but a symptom of a far larger problem; Politicism or political discrimination. This is a problem that won't be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere.\n\n**Part 1: Politicism outside university**\n\nOur recent general election, and the surprise Conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the Prime Minister, MPs and voters who 'voted wrong'. Not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.\n\n[Example 1](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OUtumWXXlN0/VU-b1Pd8ICI/AAAAAAAAADc/_SinEkUpPLY/s640/Angry13.PNG)\n\n[Example 2](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CcgZj-SKCig/VU5x_eeDAFI/AAAAAAAAACk/JRhTfGmiu48/s320/Angry10.png)\n\n[Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/1CYtJ3n.png)\n\n[Example 4](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OipKo2yAUcw/VU6EreSNo0I/AAAAAAAAADI/sxio0Tq55T4/s640/Angry12.PNG) This one was directed at me.\n\n[Example 5](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ufhTVSEGa_4/VU43Z5Y03dI/AAAAAAAAABQ/eTXN2hevU80/s400/Angry%2B3.PNG)\n\n[Example 6](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ffUSKNIwM9s/VU4w48Pvq-I/AAAAAAAAABA/gFw81ZSIwiU/s400/Angry%2B2.PNG)\n\n[Example 7](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GF87c9Ui_UM/VU5HL7BienI/AAAAAAAAAB8/5EXMiIh5m5Q/s400/Angry%2B6.PNG)\n\nThere is a certain level of \"anti-right\" culture emerging in the West whereby the left believes that, because the right are so vile and evil, any level of silencing or hatred directed at the right is justified. Needless to say, the only place I really speak my mind on the subject of politics is anonymously online or with close family. A lot of other people have the same attitude. While I was initially hesitant to call this \"censorship\", based upon the left-wing concept of \"No Platform\" I do now genuinely believe this is censorship, in many cases deliberately done.\n\n**Part 2: The Student Union**\n\nIn the UK, students are theortetically represented by the Student Union. At the national level, it is called the NUS (although not all student unions are affiliated with the NUS). This organization is so left-wing that even Maoists would call them loons. \n\nThe NUS, not Universities themselves, [is the primary source of on-campus censorship in the UK.](http://www.spiked-online.com/free-speech-university-rankings/analysis#.VYd03PlVhBc) Pro-life groups are banned at 4 universities. Right-leaning newspaper \"The Sun\" is banned at 26 theoretically for having nude models on Page 3, yet effectively identical content is still available in other publications making the actual motive of censoring right-wing content completely transparent. \n\nThe NUS even supports Boycott, Diverstment and Sanctions for Israel. The level of intimidation this can cause for Israeli students attending university in the UK is obvious.\n\nAt the NUS Women's conference 2015, proposals were put forward to replace clapping with jazz hands because of concerns that clapping would cause anxiety attacks. Additionally, gay men were accused of appropriating black female culture and a proposal was put forward to ban crossdressing.\n\nBahar Mustafa, a \"Welfare and Diversity officer\" that works for a student union, has even gotten away with [banning white people from an anti-racism event.](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/)\n\nThe NUS uses it's power to censor it's political opponents, to intimidate right-leaning students and enforce it's narrative upon new students. It completely fails to represent students, yet at the national level there is no competitor to the NUS.\n\n**Part 3: Lecturers and other university incidents**\n\n[Read this blog post in its entirety.](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/)\n\nIf you were a conservative voter studying philosophy at Royal Holloway, there is massive incentive for you to hide your views because of the hateful political attitudes of one of the faculty. No doubt similar hateful attitudes are held silently by even more faculty. This isn't even a personal blog; it's an academic one.\n\nIt's so bad that I hide my political beliefs at my own university, and I would describe myself as a Centrist, not right-leaning.\n\nThere have been multiple incidents at British universities where Israeli students or speakers have faced intimidation. [Here's just one of them.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford)\n\n**Part 4: Why affirmative action is insufficient**\n\nAffirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. Unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. If anything, it seems actively encouraged. Until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing.\n\nMy personal recommendations for the UK:\n\n* At a national level, set up a competitor to the NUS. There are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the NUS due to it's radicalism that could work together to form this. It would be politically neutral.\n\n* Prevent the NUS from enforcing censorship policies.\n\n* Fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning.\n\n* Crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported Anti-Semetic and Anti-Israeli policies enacted at universities.\n\n* Create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it.\n\n* Ensure that progenitors of Conservative ideology, such as Edmund Burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of Socialist ideology where relevant even prior to University level.\n\n* Remove communist agitprop (such as \"An Inspector Calls\") from the English Literature GCSE.\n\nIf, after enacting all these policies and waiting 20 years, there is still a severe leftist slant in UK academia, then Affirmative Action would be worth considering as a last resort.",

        "text": "Edit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no *consistent* moral framework\". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.\n\nA few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.\n\nOkay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.\n\nConsider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam\n\nHow can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?\n\nI don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.\n\nAfter giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said \"CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them\" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There's a few cases where this desire is not present (sleeping, mental disease, chronic pain…), but I think they can be satisfactorily answered one way or the other. I can elaborate, if you want me to.\n\nThis is also why I don't think animal slaughter is necessarily wrong, even if I can accept factory farming is.\n\n&gt;To your second point, pregnancy isn't an injury, so I don't feel as though the same logic applies.\n\nIt's a medical condition, a traumatic process, it can have long-lasting consequences, and is potentially deadly. The structure is the same: you do something aware of the risk, but you are not left to deal with the consequences by yourself. Instead, they are alleviated.\n\n&gt;on reddit and to be honest it's the most compelling argument so far,\n\nI do believe it's very compelling, but it also leaves a bad taste of mouth. If you change from considering abortion murder to legitimate self-defense, it still sucks.\n\nThat's why I emphasize the \"a fetus is not a person\", to liken abortion not to \"self-defense\" but \"appendix surgery\".

        "argument": "As someone who loved being homeschooled, and was much better off for it, I can say that you should at least have an understanding of something before you try to make it illegal.\n\nFirst, education takes up an extraordinarily large portion of children's lives and we should be careful when making significant changes. Because of this, you should realize that a all-inclusive legal mandate is probably not the best approach. Disregarding any issues of parental rights, it's generally more efficient and productive to allow for homeschooling. Parents are generally more in-tune to their children's needs and care more about the quality of education. Even though many academically challenged students are switched to homeschooling, homeschoolers consistently perform better on standardized testing.\n\n&gt; Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged\n\nYou should research homeschooling more, instead of relying on stereotypes, if you actually think this is the case.\n\nSecond, it's evident from your post that you do not understand the US public school system (I'm assuming US from the context of your post). Most people would laugh at the naive belief that:\n\n&gt; In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.\n\nThe most obvious issue with this is that public schools are already staggeringly unequal. Here's a great video about education and some of its issues:\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms\n\n&gt; The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage.\n\nAgain, it seems like you are basing your opinion off of ignorant stereotypes.

I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.\n\nEvery morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.\n\nI think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice guys.

        "text": "In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the ‘slippery slope’ argument that it’s legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I’m not interested in arguing whether or not this *will* happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse’s other spouse, although you could choose to do this.\n\nWhile I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? \n\nIt's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment.\n\nTo be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them.\n\nPeople sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. \n\nA big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn’t this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you’re married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document.\n\nI’m not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person’s ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don’t think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn’t mean that I’m against other people having the option.\n\nI'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don’t want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason.\n\nSo please try to CMV! I’m going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really p***ed off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I’ve committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.\n\nEdit: I'm getting a bit tired so off to bed for me before anyone else comments &amp; I feel obliged to stay up and discuss this some more! I will definitely be back so please keep the discussion going! \n\nEdit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually!\n\nEdit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down &amp; find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: \n\"While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships &amp; the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.\"\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "The best arguments against polygamy aren't moral-there isn't anything morally wrong with multiple spouses if everyone agrees-they're practical. Marriage is a major status change that you choose to enter with another person. It means the law acknowledges who can visit you in the hospital, make decisions for you if you're sick, raise your kids if you die or make decisions for them if you're absent, who can share your bank account and affect your credit rating, and who gets half your stuff in divorce. Marriage is a major change in your rights and responsibilities towards specific other people. \n\nWhen you can only be married to one person at a time, both people have to consent to it. That changes with polygamy. I agree to marry my wife, but what if later she wants to also marry her boyfriend or girlfriend? Can this third partner make decisions for the children I had with my original wife? Does the third partner get part of the property my wife and I accumulated together if they divorce out? Does their debt affect my credit score? With polygamy, your rights and responsibilities towards specific people can change *without* your consent, if one spouse chooses to marry someone else. And what if the new spouse is also married?. You might end up with a lot of people you don't know/didn't choose having the ability to majorly impact your life.\n\nEdit: I see that you respond to these kinds of arguments by suggesting people contract around it, but this isn't a workable solution for marriage. 1) Ideally, marriages last for the rest of your life. 50+ years. There is just no way to foresee and contract for every situation where you will have the opportunity to impact your spouses over that kind of time span. Marriage is fundamentally accepting the risk of future uncertainties with another person, of having to deal with the unforeseen together. That's why it's so important that people explicitly agree to the person they take that risk with. They can't effectively contract for all the unknowns and separate risks, and they might not want to be bound by the exact terms of an agreement they signed 20 years ago anyway. Love lives are not great places for contracts. 2) Even in the seemingly simple areas where you would think you can contract, you can't. Like with property, income doesn't stay separated once it comes in  to the household, and in divorce judges try to compensate people who sacrificed career opportunities in service of the family unit. There is no neat way to divide it into fractions or to give that paper fraction actual meaning out of your household property and bank account, and it will inevitably impact the spouse who did not marry the third spouse. Prenups between relatively simple two-spouse marriages are overturned, redrafted, or declared void all the time; the sense of predictability they offer is illusive, especially if you move states (every state has its own divorce laws). They wouldn't help much at all with polygamous marriages.\n\nThings can go wrong with your spouse, but you consented to the risk by marrying them.\nThings can go wrong with your children, but you accepted that risk by having and keeping children.\nThings go wrong with your spouse's spouse, and you didn't have to sign up for it to ruin your credit or garnish your wages or otherwise massively impact your life. That's an issue, and it can't be easily solved by introducing more contracts into personal relationships.",

        "text": "Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against  candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. \n\n* \"So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.\"  \n\n* \"Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details.\" \n\n* Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that \"Sanders *does* have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.\"\n\nYou hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. \n\nBut the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. \n\nSecondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?\" \n\nIf you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a \"liar,\" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.\n\nSo that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? \n\n**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it? I got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.\n\nA college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.\n\nThese are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.\n\nHonestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?\n\nI don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, \"Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.\"\n\nAgain, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "&gt;Like other left-leaning movements  \n\nThere is no \"SJW movement.\" It's just a pejorative label. There is no group that self-identifies as SJWs. There is no \"SJW\" organization. No SJW leaders. No SJW conferences.  \n\nWhat you view as a movement is just a bunch of independent people with similar conceptions of social justice, and they may have different views on politics, economics, etc.  \n\n&gt;A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.  \n\nSo...what, they shouldn't use any terms to describe certain societal phenomenons?  \n\nCis and trans are not hard concepts to learn, in fact they're being talked about all the time on the news thanks to people like Caitlyn Jenner. Gender spectrum isn't hard to figure out either. Spectrum is a pretty easy word. Combine that with gender, and it means exactly what it says on the tin!  \n\nGentrification isn't a \"SJW\" term, it's a term coined by sociologists to describe a very specific phenomenon. People who are affected by it know exactly what it is, even if they don't have a specific term to describe it. Giving it a name just makes it easier to communicate.  \n\nPrivilege is pretty easy to define. So is oppression. And identity. And assimilation. These four mean the same as their colloquial definition. Queer is something new, but it's strongly associated with gay rights so its not hard to introduce people to that term.  \n\nOtherkin isn't something people are actually pushing for, where are you getting that from? What movement and mainstream figures are pushing for otherkin rights? None, but mentioning this term is how I can tell your view is colored too heavily by what you see and hear about \"SJWs\" on this site (I'm assuming from subreddits like /r/tumblrinaction and /r/adviceanimals).  \n\nInstitutional isn't hard either, it means exactly what it sounds like. Marginalized isn't an uncommon term either.  \n\n**Note:** even if you don't agree that these terms accurately describe power dynamics in society, that doesn't mean the terms are bad\n\n&gt;These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments.  \n\nTumblr is just a blogging site with *more users* than reddit. A bunch of users on a social media site is not indicative of a social movement, especially if they don't even identify as such. Your view is skewed by what you see on reddit. They're a tiny, tiny, *tiny* fraction of users. They get attention because people like to go out and find stuff that offends them (ironically, just like the SJWs that are criticized!) and post it for cheap karma. Slap an outrageous quote on an image macro and you've got the attention of tens of thousands of users.\n\n&gt;but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas  \n\nProblem is, most people's first exposure to the idea is usually through pages dismissive of the concepts. I think that is a much bigger issue than the terms themselves. \n\n&gt;How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel?  \n\nTumblr's demographics skew pretty young, just like reddit. There's a lot of high schoolers on the site who do just fine.\n\n&gt;or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts  \n\nThese aren't advanced-level sociological concepts. These are basic 101 terms, most of which, as I've described above, match pretty closely with their colloquial definitions. I think you're exaggerating how difficult these terms are.  \n\nI'm not a sociologist nor have I taken any gender studies classes. Nowhere in college have I learned about these terms. If you were able to read about it on a blog, how high do you really think the barrier of entry is? Social media use is absolutely *huge* among youths today.\n\n&gt;How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?  \n\nBecause it gives them a name to what they're experiencing. Take for example, gentrification. A poor black family is forced out of their home due to rising rent costs because of yuppies moving in. What exactly is he supposed to call that? Do you have a better term in mind?   \n\n&gt;I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue.  \n\nYour view of social activists seems entirely limited to what you've seen on places like reddit. Stop and realize that what you're viewing is intentionally cherry-picked to enrage its audience.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, you must recognize that there are many things which you may find boring but another person may find very entertaining.\n\nFor another person, fireworks may be the shit. They may spend all day and all night fantasizing about them. They may spontaneously orgasm every 4th of July for 5 hours gazing up at the sky. I personally don't understand how people enjoy birdwatching, either, but there's plenty of people who do. You can't possibly quantify what other people like.\n\nFor the people that enjoy fireworks and fireworks shows, the relatively small risk (if you handle them properly) compared to the enjoyment they get from the experience is worth it for them. They are paying for a night which they hold fond in their memories, a sense of wonder, a feeling of pleasure. You may not understand it and may even consider it a waste of time and resources, but that's OK. No one is holding a firecracker to your head and making you enjoy it.\n\nAlso, as a personal anecdote, this isn't terribly uncommon. It seems people either love fireworks or hate them. I personally love them, but only when I'm the one lighting them. For that reason, my family has always taken turns shooting \"our\" fireworks.",

Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically many more people are killed by other forms of energy generation (I believe!). That's not to say that this isn't a worry, on some level. It's just not my top worry.\n\nI am, however, concerned about nuclear waste. The goal of developing alternative energies, to my mind, is to reduce our environmental footprint and save our ecosystem as we know it. Sure, we might slow global warming using nuclear energy - but to my knowledge, we don't really have any good way of dealing with nuclear waste. Investing in nuclear energy is just a way of trading one environmental problem for another.\n\nSecond, other forms of renewable energy are increasingly cost-effective and efficient. There's no reason to be generating nuclear power when we can do just as well with other forms of energy.\n\nThird, nuclear energy is an international conundrum. If we could move away from nuclear energy in the United States and invest globally in other forms of renewable resources, we would be able to prove, in some small way, that nuclear energy programs are unnecessary - and, therefore, give us more leverage to refuse to tolerate them in diplomatic talks.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

[Airline safety and protocols are subject to international treaties already,](https://www.faa.gov/passengers/international_travel/) and if we wanted, foreign airlines could be subjected to additional FAA safety checks as a condition of being allowed to engage in cabotage.\n\nWith the current state of the US airline industry being [so close-knit as to promote collusion,](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-doj-investigating-airlines-20150701-story.html) a healthy dose of competition seems like it's in order.  Opening up cabotage would allow a lot more competition in US aviation, which would be a big benefit to consumers as far as price.  It would also likely allow a lot of airports which aren't presently hubs to get better overseas service.

In as much as they are elected by the people they represent, Senators have a duty to exercise their powers to meaningfully represent them.\n\n2. This is a republic, not a democracy.  The objective is to have governance accountable to the people, not to have the people's will on every issue immediately enacted.  The Senate has been a valuable part of good governance in the United States, and there is great benefit in not rushing to pass legislation on the barest of legislative majorities.\n\n3.  The Senate is not able to be gerrymandered because of the fixed borders among states.  This is a major problem for how representative House seats are.

There is value in having a small legislative body whose membership does not change quickly.  There are a lot of members of the house, which means few of them have much negotiating leverage over bills, and cannot exert influence over leadership.

I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the \"sound-bit culture\" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   \n\nSpecifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically \"Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad.\" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    \n\nTo me, the fact that this \"quotable\" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    \n\nWe (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is our responsibility to be \"world police\" because we can.\n\nEdit: You guys have some very good points, let me revise my opinion. I was obviously wrong to say that we should get involved in \"all conflicts.\"  We should help people's and nations that need our help, and need us to assist them in an unfortunate situation. For example, if a brutal dictator launches an unprovoked attack on a weaker nation, we should help the weaker nation. If a rebel group is fighting a brutal dictator and trying to establish a democracy, we should help establish a democracy. \n\nLets say 2 countries both depend on a certain river for water, and the up stream nation takes all the water before it reaches its downstream neighbor. So the down steam neighbor, after trying to negotiate, resorts to warfare, and attacks its upstream neighbor. We should get involved, but not necessarily with force. We should start negotiations to get them to share the water. Or we could help the downstream neighbor develop a new source of water. The point is, we don't necessarily have to use force to solve the conflict. But if the upstream nation absolutely refused to allow the downstream nation any water, than we may have to threaten them with force, and if that doesn't work, then we could use force.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Yes prisons make it more difficult but people still manage to do it.\n\nThis idea also has a big problem similar to that of the death penalty. What if the government wrongfully convicts some and this wrongful conviction and the thought of life in prison puts someone in a state of such distress that they opt to have the prison end their life. Later evidence comes to light that shows the prisoner was innocent. Now it is slightly different because the prisoner \"chose\" to die. But the government created the situation which led to that choice being made.

        "title": "CMV: (NSFW) One needs proper consent to masturbate about someone.",
        "text": "Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.\n\nIf we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.\n\nThis line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.\n\nSo please, CMV!\n\nEDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.\n\nThanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "A few things. Firstly, to assume that you could avoid thinking of a particular person during masturbation, even if you wanted to, is ridiculous. While humans can govern the content of our thoughts to some degree, you do not have the power to govern what you think 100% of the time. Even if you made the effort, often times trying to avoid thinking about something is the surest way to guarantee that you will think about it.\n\nFor instance, whatever you do, DO NOT picture a semi-automatic handgun right now! If you are like most people, you have already done so, as the suggestion itself plants the idea and the brain conjures up the image automatically. It doesn't require any effort on your part. There's no way to self-regulate this kind of thing, let alone have others regulate it for you (or even observe the process).\n\nThere are two different levels to consider this from. The first is plausibility. Your idea isn't practical, as it isn't something you could guarantee, even if you wanted to.\n\nThe second piece is that your suggestion above implies is that other people's thoughts about you are your business. I would argue that they are not. My thoughts about the world are a representation of my inner conditions, not yours, and I will gladly and happily think whatever I like about you and you will likely never know it unless I choose to act on those thoughts via word or deed. Most of our thoughts are really just background noise anyway and our thoughts have varying degrees of consciousness associated with them, so the degree to which you can attribute intent to particular thoughts is highly questionable.\n\nAnd what of intrusive thoughts? Intrusive thoughts are a phenomena whereby we have unplanned thoughts that are sometimes disturbing in nature that simply materialize and were not planned at all (like being near the edge of a cliff and thinking about jumping).\n\nWhile regulation of behavior is important, because it directly affects the well being of others livning in society, thought is neither something that you can fully control, nor something that directly affects the agency of another (unless we act upon such thoughts).",

This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,\n\nTrying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?\n\nEDIT:\nI think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].\n\nAlso, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity.

It saddens me to see the statistics of [depression and suicide](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay#1) amongst youth in this group of people. LGBT kids are nearly 4x more likely to be depressed and suicidal than straight peers. The majority are bullied in school as well.

I understand that the world is a beautiful place because there are so many types of people. I also believe that we should make every effort to accept, love, and tolerate each other.

Everything else such as weird anatomical stuff and not being able to have children in a conventional way isn't that bad as homosexual sex is about as pleasurable as heterosexual one and artificial insemination and surrogate mothers can solve the problem of having children almost entirely.\n\nConsequently, homosexuality is bad because it limits the number of available partners, but do you know what is almost as bad? *Heterosexuality*. Fuck that crap, bisexuals have it all, they can sleep with men and women alike, they can both enjoy the 90% from the opposite sex and then 10% from their same gender, they can enjoy both genders and experience the sensations that both genders experience, they're just *objectively* superior.\n\nIt doesn't matter how much hentai you watch or how many people of the same sex you try to sleep with, the fact is that to some extent sexual orientation is genetical and you can't change it.

If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.\n\nThe people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.\n\nIf a \"buffer\" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.\n\nAlbeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution.

We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit.  More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact.  But I think we'll at least have multiple years.\n\n2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object.  They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html) to cause ablation on one side of the comet/asteroid and nudge it.  We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away.\n\n3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it.  A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.  We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life.  We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission.  Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.\n\nFirst, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.\n\nSecond, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says \"Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . .\" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.\n\nSanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions.

I support Sanders and will most likely vote for him, but I think the primary benefit that comes from his campaign is increasing awareness on the issues he supports, and increasing pressure on Clinton to take a more liberal stance to maintain the support of her base\n\nThe thing to keep in mind with that argument is that he doesn't have a chance of winning the nomination, then Hillary doesn't need to worry about keeping her base, and therefore doesn't need to shift her policies at all because she'll have the nomination. If he never gets the base to be an actual threat, then it doesn't matter what his views are because Hilary doesn't need his supporters.\n\n&gt;But let's say that Sanders was the only candidate that you'd get backlash for. Sanders would still be the most likely one to use this as a way to promote his policies on racial injustice (since, unlike many candidates, he has policies on the issue.) So at the end of the day, his supporters would be upset with the BLM movement, but would care more about Sanders' policies on the issues as he promotes them more. So it's still a win for BLM, because the only reason they care about the movement to begin with is because they think it leads to more pro-BLM policies.\n\nThe issue here is that you're assuming that only his supporters matter. If he is going to influence the nomination or have a chance at it, then his base has to grow. Imagine the case where the only news someone sees about him is that BLM are protesting him. How does that *look* to people that don't *know*? He's getting protested, Hilary is not, therefore Hilary's stance is better *even if it actually isn't*.\n\n&gt;It only seems like that if he doesn't take a strong stance on the issue now. Now there's an incentive to take a stronger stance and show the general public that the protesters are wrong, not him.\n\nThe issue here is not policies; it's being bullied off stage. If he can't stand up to 2 random people screaming, then how can we expect him to stand up to big banks, law enforcement, etc.? It's not about how it is or what's reasonable for him to do, but how it looks. At this stage, he needs to get people looking his direction and he needs them to see good things so they keep looking.

However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.\n\n\n-Travel\n\nIt's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.\nMost Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.\nYou can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.\nI don’t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.\n\n\n-Media\n\nWhen it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. \nSpecifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.\n\n\n-Availability\n\nEuropean languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.\n\nFor an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.\n\nEast Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)\n\n\n-Difficulty\n\nEast Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.\n\nA lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is “logical” and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). \nIf you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.\n\n\n-Cultural benefits\n\nIt’s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.\nLearning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. \n\nEuropean cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "I don't know if you live in the US or in the EU or whatever. But I think you miss something very simple. There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won't use. \n\nIn the case of an European, (I'm taking the Dutch as an example) \nGermany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons. Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships. which isn't there for Asian languages, because the people aren't vacationing that often in Asian countries as they do in our neighbouring countries. People that we meet in Europe often can speak an european language, even the ones that have origins in Asia, so it is easier to just keep to learning European languages if you are planning to stay inside of Europe. \n\nOne of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as an European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example. And if TV isn't enough we can just travel a few hours and go to a country where the language is spoken. While there is barely any chance to immerse yourself in Asian languages the same way.\n",

        "text": " I was thinking about why we have literature, and what it's purpose is to our society. You could say \"entertainment\", but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have some sort of moral dilemma that questions an aspect of our society. A good piece of writing is designed to make the reader feel empathetic towards the characters, so the events that occur due to the choices the characters make with regards to the dilemma, in the end will suggest to the reader what is *right* versus what is *wrong*.   \n \nI was discussing this with my girlfriend the other day, and we used \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" as an example. My point was that this book shows (among other things) that racism and prejudice is morally wrong. She argued that this wasn't the intention of the book; the book just addresses the issue of prejudice in a neutral way, and it is up to the reader's internal moral compass to decide whether racism is right or wrong. While it is certainly possible to read the book and not have your views on racism changed, I argue that it was the author's intention to suggest that it was wrong.     \n  \nHere, I extend my argument to the majority of all literature. Great works of literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, etc, are all intended to persuade readers to one side of a moral issue. Over history, stories and literature are a great way of defining what we as a race have defined as right and wrong.  \n\n**CMV!**\n  \n  \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "An argument can certainly be made that literature exists as means to explore the human condition, but morality is only one part of that.  The bulk of narrative works contain an element of morality in the story, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the work is about morality.  Rather, the reason that so many stories contain moral themes is because morality is an essential part of the human condition.  Consciousness, thought, knowledge, growth, life, death, society, and empathy (which is inexplicably tied to morality) are all crucial parts of the human experience, and the bulk of narrative works also contain these elements and, either explicitly or implicitly, make judgments and statements about them.  Along with morality, all of these are part of the collective human condition, not morality alone, to which these stories allude.",

        "title": "CMV: MRAs are right to claim that there are men's issues. However, the way they're trying to address them is ineffective and quite possibly makes things worse.",
        "text": "The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. That's disgusting, and obviously I could list many other real problems.\n\nBut the MRM is not the best solution to these problems, and often gives men's issues such bad press that it's toxic to defend them. In other words, it's not the MRM's fault that these problems exist, but it's actively damaging to the cause, quite possibly more than it has helped.\n\nDistancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into \"men's activists\" and \"women's activists.\" This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman. This is not a victory for women's rights. Everyone loses, because a criminal walks free while an innocent person sits in jail. Sure, there are extremists who will claim to hate all men and think this is fine, but there are also crazy atheists who claim to hate all religious people. This isn't \"no true Scotsman,\" this is pointing out that it's unreasonable to define a group by its crazies, because if we did, no group would be reasonable. \n\nPitting MRAs against feminists undermines the notion of actual gender equality and makes it a \"men vs. women\" debate, which we all lose. \n\nIt would seem, to me, that a better strategy to promote men's issues would be to do it within the feminist movement. The feminist movement has existed for a long time and (relative to the MRM) is reasonably positively regarded. People get behind feminist issues. MRAs often complain that no feminists care about men's issues, but a) this doesn't seem to be entirely true unless we're yelling about strawmen and extremists and b) this would be even less true if people stopped leaving feminism/gender egalitarianism for the MRM. It looks like people are ditching feminism for the MRM and then complaining that feminists don't care about men's issues, which is only true because anyone who did left. Why can't we all just work together? I get that there are people who identify with all of the above, but it seems like EVERYONE who considers themselves ANY of the above should care about all of the above. I really can't think of an intellectually honest reason to care only about men's issues or women's issues. They're both real. So why are we treating them as opposing forces? It's not like we have to ban abortions because we start listening to male victims of violence. This isn't a zero sum game, why is it being treated as one? Everyone seems to think it is, and it just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nSome things I anticipate people saying:\n\n\"What about gender egalitarians?\"\n\nI think rebranding feminism as gender egalitarianism would probably be the best solution, but that's going to take a hell of a lot of time. One thing that would help is if feminists started acting like gender egalitarians and actually cared about all gender issues, and MRAs joining up with them would only speed up the process. As for people who consider themselves \"feminists and gender egalitarians,\" I see no issue. \"Feminist, MRA, and gender egalitarian\" is fine too, although I've never encountered one who phrased it like that. Those who consider themselves anti-feminists but gender egalitarians... Eh. I really don't know, but I feel like shitting on feminism in general is not helpful to the gender equality discussion. (this is as opposed to legitimate critiquing, which is fair game. I'm not saying anything anyone labelled \"feminist\" does is above reproach, nor anything the movement does. I'm saying condemning all of modern feminism and trying to start from scratch is really unhelpful, especially when a huge part of the world is still incredibly patriarchal; see countries where getting raped is still a crime--if you're female). \n\n\"Feminists aren't open to men's issues. I hear what you're saying, but that's not possible.\"\n\nBecome a feminist open to men's issues. You're listening to one right now. Make that two and we're one step closer.\n\n\"It's right for men's and women's issues to have different advocates because they are different. You might as well be saying that feminism should just merge with the LGBTQ rights movement.\"\n\nI don't think that's true. Men's and women's issues differ, but they are rooted in the same fundamental ideas. The reason men are arrested when they are the victim of domestic violence by women is that we live in a society that sees women differently from men. It's benevolently sexist to say that a woman simply couldn't hurt a man except in self-defense. It's also hostile sexist against men to say that men are simply violent people. Men's and women's issues are intrinsically linked, because stereotypes and perceptions of gender roles are the root of both. Essentially, I think men's and women's issues are symptoms of the same problem, so they can be addressed together.\n\n\"Is your problem with anti-feminists, or MRAs? You seem to move between the two.\"\n\nBoth, to some degree. I don't think it's fair to treat those two entirely separately, given the links. MRAs who are anti-feminist are the ones I disagree with most. People who identify as MRAs but also feminists I'm largely okay with, but the MRM in general is not terribly kind to feminists and borders on actively anti-feminist, which is the problem I'm talking about here.\n\nEdit: Guys, I want to have a conversation! I really am open to chatting about this and changing my view. I know lots of CMV users love the MRM, it gets brought up all the time... I want to understand your perspective. I don't bite.\n\nEdit2: Well, I asked and you delivered! Definitely an interesting conversation here. Credit to u/Prince_of_Savoy for highlighting issues with feminism that make it inherently poorly compatible with the MRM. I'll be checking back and responding to comments that might get added later tonight, but I may not get to all of them--sorry about that! I am reading and listening to all that is said, and I appreciate the many varied takes on the issue that have come up.\n\nEdit3: Okay, there are still new, good comments being posted, but there's also a fair bit of needless vitriol. I'm not responding to any comment that was rude, so if you came here to post that, you won't be hearing from me. Namecalling doesn't change views and just makes you look like a dick.",
        "argument": "You seem to be coming from the premise that the anti-male parts of the feminist movement and the anti-feminist parts of the MRM are similarly extreme. I would disagree. Reading men's rights campaigners such as Ally Fogg (who I would highly recommend), I see a battle for one of the few campaigners whose motivation is to improve the lives of men, rather than as a reaction against feminism, to find a collective he can work with. He is forced to spend almost as much time fighting MRAs as anti-male feminists, simply because he recognises that the way to achieve his equality aims is not to blame everything on women. My contention is that until the MRM can move on from the reactionary core that defines so much of its work, and recognise the value of feminism and the equality of women (which includes accepting the ways in which women are still disadvantaged), the idea that feminism should accept MRAs and concede to their perspectives would be a betrayal of feminism's most fundamental principles. \n\nSo, in conclusion, I agree with your suggestion of collaboration in principle, but the reactionary and misogynistic principles that make up so much of the MRM make this impossible in the short term.

        "title": "CMV: Ads on Hulu are no different from ads we've gotten on cable TV for decades, and people who complain about it are just spoiled.",
        "text": "This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding.  For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want.  Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content.\n\nAnd yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu.  My perception of their argument is this: \"I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.\"  Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that.\n\nNow, I should say I definitely understand hating ads.  I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something.  We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful.  Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite).\n\nBut even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it.\n\nI see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works.  I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be.  Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired.\n\nNetflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished.  And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens.  The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company.\n\nI've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV.  Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it.  I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies.  They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work.  Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming.\n\nPeople are so quick to jump to the \"X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores\" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work.  I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads.  \"I don't like watching ads\" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account.  People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then.\n\nI think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off.  Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways.  It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models.  But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising.\n\nSo my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen.  I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part.  I'd like to see if someone can shift my bias and provide me some insight I'm not aware of.\n\nEDIT: /u/ceader is the one who ultimately changed my view.  I'm still kind of skeptical about some people's criticisms towards Hulu, but I'm definitely more understanding of why people don't want to pay for ads.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This \" forcing ideals on others\" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. \n\nFor a hypothetical:\n\nIt's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I \" forcing my ideals on them\" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am \"forcing my ideals\" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  \n\nThe abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.",

        "text": "Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: \"how does it come about that this right is inherent?\"\n\nWhat makes this right inherent?\n\nThere is a difference between rights granted  by law and natural rights. Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherent/natural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.)\n\nThere still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.\n\nIf \"Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter.\" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?\n\n\"It just does\" is not a sufficient answer.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights\n\nExplain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.\n\nI actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a \"gun-grabber\" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone.\n\nTo be clear: I could give a **** about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all.\n\nAt the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter.\n\nI am currently against both \"gun grabbers\" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate.\n\nTell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end.\n\nif you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate _any_ argument defending your position) , you are probably not really going to convince anyone.\n\nBut If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save?\n\nTo claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God.\n\nI see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also \"justify\" the \"rights of monkeys to bear arms\".)\n\nI invite you to Change My View.",
        "argument": "I'll do my best with this.\n\n&gt;Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.\n\nIn the link you provided it's pretty clear that the right to live is a natural right. Well, if you are ever in a situation where your right to live is being threatened, how else are you going to defend that right? To me, logic dictates that the right to live and the right to self defense are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, if you accept my statements above then we can move to why gun rights are a natural right. It's best to use examples of self defense situations. \n\nHere's an example of situation people have and could face. I'm hanging out in my house and someone (or a couple people) breaks in and they have a baseball bat(s) or some other deadly objects. If it is my right to live and therefore my right to self defense then I should have the best means of self defense available to me. Now, just to be clear, the best means in general isn't the best means in all situations, just that it's going to be better suited for a variety of situations. This is where a gun comes in to the picture. \n\nI'm in my house that now has a stranger(s) that's armed with a weapon(s), what am I supposed to do? There is the intention to harm me and I have to choose how best to defend myself. I could grab a bat, a golf club, a knife, etc., but what's the likelihood of one of those options actually being viable in this situation? I would be going toe to toe with someone who could be bigger, stronger and more prepared. What are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? \n\nAnother option I could have is grabbing a gun, which is capable of dealing necessary force within a matter of seconds while potentially keeping some distance between me and that attacker. Now I have to ask the same question, what are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? \n\n&gt;But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment.\n\nHere's the problem, if you take away firearms then there is no longer an equalizer for a whole variety of situations, just like the example I have presented. There is the potential that you will be in a situation where you are having to defend yourself from someone else that has a gun, but at least it would be a lot closer to a \"fair\" fight. Having a gun doesn't require much strength, size, agility, etc., but with things like a bat, knife and hammer, those attributes absolutely play a role. \n\n&gt;Since guns take more lives than they save?\n\nThere's isn't any proof that this is a fact. Since the number of defensive gun uses is a very hard statistic to gather, it is unknown if guns save more live or cost more lives. One thing you have to consider is if you get rid of guns, that doesn't inherently mean that those lives wouldn't have been lost by other means. If you look at countries like England and Australia, the total number of murders and crime was unaffected by their gun control measures. If you actually look at the crime and murder rates in those countries, those statistics actually increased the first couple years after their gun bans. They did eventually start to decrease, but the US has also steadily decreased in the same periods. Sure there is less gun related crimes in those countries, but crimes were just committed by other means.\n\nI feel like I'm rambling on a bit at this point, so I'll leave it at this for now. If you feel like there is an important point of yours that I've messed, I can do my best to respond to that as well.",

Seems very hypocritical, no?\n\nThe point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.\n\nIt all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well.

If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and \"gotchas.\"  \n\nA crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.\n\nThis is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.\n\nAs far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.

        "argument": "For the rest of the conversation, let's assume that this idea gains enough support to become mainstream. I'd rather focus on the simulations. (Note: I would love for all this to become real, but I do need to point out some severe shortcomings.)\n\n&gt; Though diplomacy can be built into it as well. For instance, you could have a simulated German Chancellor or someone on the phone who the candidate needs to convince to do something. The candidate would have a pre-call briefing where they could discuss an ask, devise strategy, etc, and then has to make the call, can try to do it all themselves, let advisors negotiate, etc.\n\nA big part of diplomacy, as you know, is that it doesn't always work. In a simulated scenario, the candidate would have no qualms about doing everything to come out on top. It's a win-win as far as political points go. Realistically, the public will judge the nominee as being \"strong\" when dealing politicians of other countries. As in, the nominee \"showed\" Germany what's what. (Rah! Rah! 'Murica!) It would be a lot more interesting to see a foreign policy simulation in Denmark than America, in my opinion. If I haven't made my point clear here, just let me know and I'll try to explain further. The gist of it is that there's no incentive for the nominee to lose the negotiation, though it could actually be the better course in the real world, depending on what's being talked about. This is coming from the support that Trump is drumming up by talking of \"beating\" China when it comes to trade deals.\n\n&gt; This is true, but the extended nature of it and the ability of the simulation runner to throw curveballs at them would force some real decisionmaking. You can't run out the clock with platitudes in a simulation. You have to say whether you'll bail out the banks or not (or whatever the choice is).\n\n&gt;&gt; But the raw video would be out there, and people could watch it. Would people spin it? Absolutely. But it's not like they aren't spinning everything now. This would hopefully provide some meaningful insight into the candidates. And the public and media will do with that what they will.\n\nThis is a blessing and a curse, in my opinion. Given that everyone understands that the simulations are inconsequential, the coverage has other consequences. It would just let the nominees \"act\" presidential and grandstand all the way. Every decision would be followed by a political quip (or a little speech) that would reinforce their ideology. It's reality TV! (I hate reality TV.)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 1999 the two countries engaged in the [Kargil War (or Kargil Conflict)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War#WMDs_and_the_nuclear_factor), and this was after both countries had tested their nuclear weapons in 1998.

Not every nation is as politically developed as the current cache of countries that do possess these weapons. Even now, there's huge risk of proliferation. What if one country sold (or supplied) its weapons to some terrorist agency?

        "text": "Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:\n\nFirst, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. \n\nSecond of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. \n\nAll in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.\n\nEdit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The specific fallacy that you're coming close to here is called \"Social Darwinism\". That's the error in thinking when someone thinks that natural selection, which applies to individual organisms and genes, can therefore apply to social systems and societies. This is one of the most serious errors that anyone who thinks about any of these topics can make. \n\nSocial Darwinism was popular 100 years ago and contributed directly to imperialism and scientific racism, and thus, to hyper-nationalism, fascism and Nazism. It's a pity that it should be named after Darwin (it would be more accurately called Herbert Spencer-ism, since he was the one more responsible for distorting the principle of natural selection and applying it to human societies). \n\nThe riposte to this is simple; human individuals and genes are natural phenomena, subject to natural selection. Human societies and cultures are *artificial* phenomena, and therefore, are not. To mix up the two is sheer confusion, and will lead to a whole lot of other errors. If you like Richard Dawkins, you will see that he too in his published works and speeches is careful not to commit this error. \n\nThere is another writer, also influenced by Darwin, who wrote about evolution and animal behaviour and came to different conclusions than Herbert Spencer, called Pyotr Kropotkin. He wrote a book called Mutual Aid, A Factor in Evolution, which came to the conclusion that sociality and social co-operation were important factors in the survival of species. Altruism in animals does exist, and can be explained in evolutionary terms. \n\nBut in any case we must remember not to apply the principles of natural selection to such artificial things as human societies and cultures. \n",

        "text": "This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. \n\nThis needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. \n\nMen work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women.\n\nMen work more standard hours than women.\n\nWomen take more sick days off work than men.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work.\n\nA small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month.\n\nTo use anecdotal evidence, yesterday i came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. \n\n\nDue to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. \n\nWhat I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. \n\nI am not saying that women *deserve* to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born , and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. \n\nThus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation.

        "argument": "&gt;Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women.\n\nWell, more work does not necessarily mean more money.  Especially when womens' participation [tends to be undervalued relative to its importance for success](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html?_r=0).  Although you've listed a number of reasons that women might be expected to add less value, you're falling victim to the problem noted in the above link.  You're focusing on those negatives and ignoring the ways in which women tend to add more value than men.  [Another NYT piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/opinion/sunday/adam-grant-and-sheryl-sandberg-on-discrimination-at-work.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article) on gender in the workplace included the following paragraph, I would recommend that you read the rest as well.\n\n&gt;When more women lead, performance improves. Start-ups led by women are [more likely to succeed](http://www.dowjones.com/collateral/files/womenpe_report_final.pdf); innovative firms with more women in top management are [more profitable](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.1955/abstract); and companies with more gender diversity [have more](http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/2/208.short) revenue, customers, market share and profits. [A comprehensive analysis](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-15222-001/) of 95 studies on gender differences showed that when it comes to leadership skills, although men are more confident, women are more competent.\n\nWomens' lower earnings cannot be explained as the result of differences in biological or psychological capacity.  If such factors explained the difference in pay, we would expect to see higher pay for women in leadership roles than for men - after all, it looks like they're objectively better at it.  But we don't.  Don't blame the results of bias on capitalism.  ",

        "title": "CMV: The reason people don't listen to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music does not usually contain a drum set.",
        "text": "As a lifelong classical musician, I am absolutely in love with the repertoire of symphony orchestras, opera, and chamber music. I am always trying to think of ways to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. \n\nSo here it is: I believe that the main reason people don't like listening to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music rarely includes a drum set. \n\nDefinitions I use in this CMV: \n\nClassical music: not only music from the classical period. I'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras, or chamber ensembles. What a non-musician would think of as \"classical.\" Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. \n\nPopular music: not just the narrow genre of \"pop,\" but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies, to country, to EDM, to metal, and beyond. \n\nNow to explain my view:\n\nI really don't think there's that much difference between classical music and other genres. \n\n-Both genres use the same 12 notes. (The exception obviously being microtonal classical music, which even as a career classical musician, sometimes I have a really hard time appreciating. But 99.9% of classical music uses the same 12 notes as popular music.)\n\n-Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities (major/minor chords, added 7ths, 9ths, etc.). \n\n-Both have the same basic choices of meters. (4/4 time, mixed meter, etc.)\n\n-Both use many of the same instruments. (Guitars aren't exclusive to popular music, and violins and 'celli aren't exclusive to orchestras.)\n\n-Both contain pieces with text/lyrics, and both genres also contain pieces that are purely instrumental. (A lot of people point to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music, but both genres have music with text/lyrics.)\n\n-In the pieces with text/lyrics, both genres use many languages besides English. (Lots of people say they can't understand classical music sung in German, yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and don't mind looking up a translation, or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics.)\n\n-Both genres contain relatively short pieces (3-5 minutes) and longer pieces (10+, or even 60 minutes+). (So the length of composition isn't really a big factor, since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre.)\n\nSo those are many of the similarities I can think of. But one thing that's really different between most (not all) classical music and most (not all) of popular music is the fact that the drumset (or electronic beat, or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar, or vocal percussion, or something that makes a similar sound) keeps really obvious control of the rhythm at all times. It's really hard not to know where the beat is in popular music, whereas in classical music, sometimes the meter is a bit more obscure. \n\nI think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music, and so the accessibility of the rhythmic feel in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. \n\nContrast this to classical music, where sometimes, even to a trained musician, the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases, the meter may be clear to someone who knows what they're listening for, but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece, which I contend is the reason that people don't enjoy classical music as much.\n\nTo clarify: I'm not coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I'm not assigning value judgments here, or trying to be an elitist. I'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to be. And to me, the lack of a drumset (or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature) in classical music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. \n\nOne final caveat: In this CMV, I'm mostly talking about listening to music on one's own, like at your house, or on your own iPod. I think the experience of attending a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really different one. I don't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can feel a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert, I don't think there's much difference to putting on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the Beatles when you're on your own and not in a concert setting. \n\nThe reason I'd like my view changed: I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical music so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical music is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by finding out the real reasons that people don't already listen to it. \n\nThe main thing that I think will CMV: \n\n-Compelling examples of features people like about popular music that are unique to popular music. Not features that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical music is not. \n\nTL;DR: Classical music almost never has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener. People like feeling rhythmically grounded, and so popular styles are more accessible to a wider audience.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "Could you be looking at this from the wrong angle? You're asking two completely different things: 1) Why people don't listen to classical music; 2) Is it because classical music doesn't have a drum set?\n\nThe way I see it is that most people stick with what they're used to or exposed to at some formative age. I know someone who listened to a ton of classical music because his father used to play it in the house while he was growing up. His dad was very knowledgeable about the composers, artists, etc. and passed that on to his son. I, on the other hand, was exposed to a ton of classical rock (from my friends) when I was growing up. That's still the music that I like the most, and he still likes classical music best. In fact, I didn't get into classical music at all (I'm still a noob) until I watched Requiem for a Dream and got blown away by the soundtrack - Kronos Quartet did an amazing job. Though my friend tried, I was resistant to it because of my own lack of \"training.\"\n\nThat's how it is with exposure to music. If you show me what's \"popular\" right now I would just stare blankly at the list. The whole Taylor Swift/Nicki Minaj drama meant nothing to me because I don't know a single song by Minaj. So it isn't a matter of the qualities of the music, it's more about exposure and discovery. Classical music isn't a presence the same way pop music is. I think that's what accounts for the difference in popularity.\n\nGreat post, by the way. Let me know what you think about my $0.02.",

What you're really saying is \"they will never agree with my correct view, therefore I need to force them to change for the betterment of all.\" There's a utility to that but I personally believe it's dangerous.\n\nAdvocating discourse and advocating for violence are polar opposites.  It's ironic that someone from the LGBT community would advocate for the latter over the former, considering the fact that if you went back 100 years, it was majority heterosexuals seeking to impose their will via violence to curb homosexuality.  Now, we find that sort of behavior atrocious.  \n\nDiscourse however allows for the free flow of thoughts and ideas to change the minds and hearts of others.

        "argument": "Since the lives of cattle are unpleasant, on the surface it seems that slaughtering them at an earlier age would minimize suffering and would therefore be less immoral.\n\nThe reality of veal however, is that it is essentially a by-product of the dairy industry.  To keep cows lactating they must constantly be producing calves.  Excess male calves are often used for veal rather than raised as steers, or (very rarely) breeding bulls simply because it takes less time and space away from their more profitable mothers.  A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.\n\nSo while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.  Add to the fact that many of these calves wouldn't have to be born or suffer at all if not for their essential role in keeping dairy cows lactating.",

        "argument": "&gt; marriage is not about reproduction. \n\nThis is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. \n\nI imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children.

Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw\n\nHere is the gist of my viewpoint:\nIn the US, when a person is terminated from a job, he/she is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go 'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people.\n\nIn the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.\n\nMy stance is that if having a child is a choice, it should be one the parents must prepare for financially before making - just like if they wanted to voluntarily take time off work for other reasons.\n\nWe have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes.\n\nI completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason.\n\nChange My View.\n\nEDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this. But I would LOVE it if companies started doing it voluntarily and think it would be a huge positive for attracting top talent. But it should be between employers and employees to figure out compensation packages. \n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Not to mention the massive toll physically and mentally that giving birth takes on the mother. Allowing the mother time to rest and be around her baby is a good thing.

I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.\n\nEvery morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.\n\nI think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice guys.

I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so.\n\nAlso, downvotes don't change views, people. \n\n***\n\nI've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me.\n\nMy personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management.\n\nI can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.) It seems like the wish to die in and of itself is a basis to claim that someone is not acting in their right state of mind, which I think is illogical and unfortunate. \n\nI know this paragraph was written somewhat messily, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to provide some context for my view. I will be happy to clarify anything for anyone that asks.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "text": "So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.\n\nExample 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they \"seem happy,\" or \"they don't run away\" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.\n\nExample 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with \"consent.\"\n\nSo that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!\n\nEdit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. \n\nEdit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not \"convince me that bestiality is wrong\" or \"convince me that bestiality hurts animals\"; it is \"convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.\"\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "You are saying:\n\n1. We don't require an animal's consent for being kept as a pet, nor for eating it or consuming its milk, so consent is not relevant to human-animal interactions;\n2. Sex is just another human-animal interaction;\n3. Hence consent is also not relevant to humans having sex with animals, aka bestiality.\n\nClearly (1) is true, and (3) is a simple logical inference. But the weak point in your argument is (2), i.e., your assumption that there isn't anything special about sex.\n\nIn actuality, there are some things that are special about sex, in particular in regards to consent. We are ok with an adult playing basketball with a consenting minor, or forcing a minor to go to school even without consent, but we are not ok with an adult having sex with a minor in any situation. In other words, there are things adults can do with children that do not require their consent (forcing them to go to school) and there are things we do not consider children to be able to consent to in any situation (sex), even though the majority of adult-child interactions are guided by consent (playing basketball).\n\nThe argument could then be made, that animals are a parallel to children. Animals can be forced to do some things without their consent, like keeping them as pets or eating them for food, which would parallel adults forcing children to go to school. We don't require consent in those areas. And there are some things that we just do not consider animals to be able to consent to, and are therefore forbidden, namely sex, which would be a direct parallel to sex with children.\n\nNow, you make a fair point that there might be a form of inconsistency here - why is it ok to ignore consent in some areas, and not in sex? However, the same potential inconsistency exists in society's treatment of children, and not just in society's treatment of animals, so if there is an inconsistency (debatable) it is at least one which society applies in a consistent way between animals and children.\n",

        "title": "CMV: A minimum wage increase will hurt the poor and the economy, not help it.",
        "text": "Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or in the process of mandating a minimum wage of ~$15/hour. While on the surface, this seems like a good policy for strengthening the poor/middle class I believe this will ultimately HURT, not help the public, and especially the poor. \n\nHere are several common arguments made in favour of the raising minimum wage and my response:\n\n* \"Average wages haven't increased despite an increase in production and profit in the economy\"\n\nIt's a common misunderstanding that wages are/should be directly tied to production. In reality wages are determined just like prices of anything else, through supply and demand. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled and easily replaceable (through either humans or automation) making the supply of labour far larger than the demand, which equals a lower wage. The rise in technology that has resulted in higher production from labour has little affect on wages. \n\n* \"Current minimum wages are so low that they do not pay a livable annual salary, keeping the working poor in a perpetual state of poverty\"\n\nI would challenge the idea that most minimum wage jobs were ever meant to be sustainable for living. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled labour (ex. factory work, assembly lines) or service industry jobs (cooks, janitorial staff, retail jobs etc..). At least to me, these seem like temporary work done by people in the process of finding higher paying employment (students, recent graduates, new immigrants etc...), and not intended as a career at all, so a livable wage is not required. \n\n* \"A higher minimum wage would increase the income of many in the population, boosting spending, saving and the overall economy.\"\n\nAs I said previously, the vast majority of minimum wage jobs are easily replaceable, outsourced or automated. If large companies are forced by government to pay high minimum wages, they will seek cheaper alternatives and replacements instead. For example, a McDonald's hamburger could very easily be made faster, cheaper, cleaner and better by a machine, [like this one, which makes a burger every 10 seconds ](http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-burger-robot-2014-8). If the minimum wage gets high enough that it costs McDonald's more to pay 10 people to flip burgers than one machine, they will simply replace the human labour altogether. This will result in an increase in unemployment. So while those who retain their minimum wage jobs will be better off, many will simply be replaced, leaving the unemployed workers in a WORSE position than before. \n\nHere are some things that would change my view: \n\n* Research evidence that demonstrates positive impact from countries/states that have already raised minimum wage\n\n* A justification that the minimum wage must be a \"living wage\"\n\n* Evidence that a wage increase would not result in the loss of unskilled jobs to outsourcing, automation etc...\n\n* Any other reasonable justification of minimum wage\n\n\nPlease change my view!\n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "how about this (the conclusion of the study): [\"Economists have conducted hundreds of studies of the employment impact of the minimum wage. Summarizing those studies is a daunting task, but two recent meta-studies analyzing the research conducted since the early 1990s concludes that the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. The most likely reason for this outcome is that the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms' overall costs and only modest relative to the wages paid to low-wage workers. In the traditional discussion of the minimum wage, economists have focused on how these costs affect employment outcomes, but employers have many other channels of adjustment. Employers can reduce hours, non-wage benefits, or training. Employers can also shift the composition toward higher skilled workers, cut pay to more highly paid workers, take action to increase worker productivity (from reorganizing production to increasing training), increase prices to consumers, or simply accept a smaller profit margin. Workers may also respond to the higher wage by working harder on the job. But, probably the most important channel of adjustment is through reductions in labor turnover, which yield significant cost savings to employers.\"](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf)\n\nSo yeah, it doesn't cause job losses to increase the minimum wage a reasonable amount.",

I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. \n\n     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.\n\nEdit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.\n\nEdit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.\n\nEdit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV\n\n---Edit---\nMany responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.\n\nTo CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV\n\n(also, deltas incoming for added info on the topic.

I think there are instances where suicide is selfish (people who have children that still rely on them) but if you have no responsibilities such as that then it could be your reasons are actually very selfless.

        "text": "Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by \"legitimacy\" I'm talking about how valid the wish to die is in the first place. I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so.\n\nAlso, downvotes don't change views, people. \n\n***\n\nI've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me.\n\nMy personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management.\n\nI can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.) It seems like the wish to die in and of itself is a basis to claim that someone is not acting in their right state of mind, which I think is illogical and unfortunate. \n\nI know this paragraph was written somewhat messily, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to provide some context for my view. I will be happy to clarify anything for anyone that asks.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as \"free thinker\", \"skeptic\", \"reason\" and \"logic\" to push their agenda.

Like i get it Fox news is racist, but i dont have to be racist because i critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that i cant even. \n\n-We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler.

Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard.\n\nLike seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like \"HAHAHA, you believe that?\" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt.\n\nThe way i see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not \"hurt precious feelings\". I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled \"Euphoric\" or \"fedora wearing neckbeard\". \n\nI wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way i see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way i want our society to change its view is  for people to watch all three videos  below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality.

        "title": "CMV: I believe that socialism is fundamentally better than capitalism",
        "text": "For the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.\n\nAnd that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.\n\nNot only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). \n\nSo, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.\n\nI guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!\n\nEDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve.\n\nAcually global starvation levels have plummeted since China under Dang Xiapeng went through a capitalistic switch in economic thinking,  more than 500M chinness people have enterned the middle class while the rest are being lifted up. \n\n[Starvation falling](http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/Learn/world%20hunger%20facts%202002.htm) \n\n[Dang Xiapeng Economic Revelation Graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif)\n\n\n\n&gt;Clical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.\n\nWell what you see as faluires other countries see as success example look at China pre Deng Xiaoping and how 60m-70m people starved to death and this is a country that has a larger landmass than the US and has very good farm land, the government organized farmers in antempt to bring people out of poverty the end solution was 60m-70m died due to starvation.\n\n\nThis graph shows the best, in 1978/1979 China Privitized it's farms and they went to a market based system lifting 100s of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.(look at this graph: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif)\n\n\nOther countries have followed suit to achieve the same success and what is needed to fund this growth in the economy when you aren't as devolped........child labour every country did it from England, USA, to Canada\nTo say it's only capitalist flaw, that's wrong the Soviet Union had it, Anceint Egypt, North Korea, and many more none capitalistic countries, whenever you have quick growth starting from the bottom everyone works from 5 year olds to 80 year olds.\n\n\nCapitalism has produced the richest \"People\" in the world record number of people are not starving to death more people are going to schools and are getting treated in hospitals, even some illness that killed millions a 100 hundred years ago has been cured due to capital in the market place.﻿\n\nTheses countries are devolping just like we did 100 years ago and they are going to go through the same things and no one will be able to stop them, look at polls done in China in the 1990s about if their better off know the numbers were in the 90% agreeing they had a better life currently.\n\n\n&gt;Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot).\n\n\nWell that's not a fair argument since the Soivet Union, North Korea, and other Socialist countries back in the 70s and 80s were known to use the worste envirmental standards in the world.\n\nAlso the reason we need oil production still is the fact we need things, even solar power, hydro, wing, and electronic cars still use oil in the production of that item. \n\n\n\n&gt; Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.\n\nTo those people I say what job are they working? My degree is going to allow me to make a decent living, while a lot of people who have taken weak degree are falling behind, because they think, because they have a degree they should be paid a good salary.",

This is false though and I would like the chance to prove to you that apples are the better, more versatile fruit.\n\nAlcohol: drinking is awesome and fun. Rarely do you hear about anything orange though, outside of being a garnish or in liquers. Apples are the full feature alcohol fruit that can come in cider or wine form, as well and being used in the same fashions oranges could, liquers and garnishes. No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.\n\nFood: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.\n\nDiversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. \n\nJuice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool.\n\nPop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called \"Navels\" or \"Valencia\" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, \"life is like a crate of apples...\" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety.

This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. \n\n\nI realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.\n\nSadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.\n\nAdd to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.\n\nI didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker.

My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. \n\nMy POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?\n\n\nTl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.\n\nEven working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. \n\nI feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. \n\nFurther, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in *engineering* from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.\n\nAnd to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. \n\nSo? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.\n\nEdit: [Delta awarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind.

If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  \n\n- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. \n\n- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. \n\n- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day.

The Hindeburg disaster only killed just over a third of the people on board; the majority of airliner crashes kill everyone on board. Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps. \n\nThe truth is, airships were an idea that was completely out of step with its times; during the period where they were most economically viable, materials and engine technology, among many other things, were barely adequate to deal with their demands. An airship built to Zeppelin scales with modern materials technology and design techniques would be dramatically stronger, lighter, faster and safer, with aramid fibre skins stretched over composite frames. They would have satellite navigation and meteorology, and onboard weather radar to avoid dangerous weather; computerised systems would monitor hydrogen pressure and static build-ups, modern escape and fire suppression systems would provide a final back-up. Moreover, there is the potential to use solar power and electric motors to run these flying behemoths essentially for free, making them far more economically viable, both for passengers who don't mind a slower, more stately trip and for container cargo.

        "argument": "The presence of present suffering does not equal future suffering.\n\n**Be happy.** The complicated part is how to achieve this.\nThe first thing one must do, is to figure out why they are here. In the grand scheme of things, what does their life mean? One needs to find some type of spirituality. For those who believe in a deity it may not be as difficult, but for those who do not, a void is often left. The first place to start for an atheist is to recognize the sheer improbability of one’s own consciousness. The fact that billions of years ago energy condensed into matter, this matter consolidated to form giant space rocks, these rocks flew past each other altering each other’s trajectory through space, one just happened to settle next to an appropriate size star and at the appropriate distance, amino acids on this rock came together in the perfect conditions, created life, life evolved, and you became you.\n\nNot only is it amazing that you are here. The fact that you know you are here is amazing. I think therefore I am. (I refine Descartes’ statement as, “I am aware, therefore I am.”) Knowing how all this happened, and realizing the time scale, one can start to appreciate the gift of the short time of consciousness we are all given by the cosmos. We only have a short time in existence so it is important to attain this happiness while we are here, this appreciation of our consciousness is the first step.\nMany people subconsciously know they want happiness, but are confused as to how to get there. I find it unsettling when I hear people worry about growing up to be a janitor or some other career that is unjustly looked down upon by society. Don’t get me wrong, a person needs money to be happy, but the only reason they need it is to fulfill Maslow’s basic needs. All other acquirements are superfluous. What people don’t study enough is what creates happiness, they only study what creates money.\n\nWhat we must realize is that we are the human animal. When is a dog at its happiest? Is it happy when it is in a cage, cooped up, with no stimulation? Or is it happiest when it is running around, playing fetch? A dog is happiest when it is being a dog and doing dog things. The same goes for humans. Humans are happiest when they are actualizing their human nature. When we notice the presence of mirror neurons, and the negative feelings that arise in ourselves when we hurt someone, and notice the positive feelings that arise when we help someone, we can start to understand our true nature. Often when people come home from war, after having killed, after destroying other consciousness’s, they become suicidal or depressed. Conversely, new mothers and fathers often describe the day their child was born, the day they created consciousness, as “the happiest day of my life.” These are actions humans take that are at two ends of a spectrum, with many other actions that affect other people in between. Insulting someone and complimenting someone are also two opposite actions on this spectrum. When I ask myself why I want to have children I cannot come up with an obvious rational answer, but when I notice that procreating is ingrained in the human species and life itself, the answer becomes clear. I want to have children because I am human, and that’s what humans do. Humans become happy when they are moral beings because it is especially in our nature. We are more conscious than most species because of our social nature. Our higher level thinking has arisen, through evolution, specifically as a result of our need to navigate social intricacies. We are fundamentally connected with each other and when we act like it we reap personal internal rewards.\n\n",

However, if you state with an idea, let's say \"Forks are a blight upon society\", and someone disagrees with you, if you immediately jump to free speech as defense of your idea, you are basically admitting that you have no worthwhile arguments. Yes, you are allowed to say that, but if you actually had something to back it up, say \"sporks are far more versatile, cutting the required utensil manufacturing by a third, reducing global warming 93%\", you would say that. Free speech does nothing to back up the validity of your claim, as you are free to be wrong.\n\nEDIT: I have been convinced that it can be a way of simply saying you do not wish to argue the point further, that you want to let the argument stand where it does.\n\nAnd, to clarify, I am not talking about free speech as a legal concept. Having to prove your speech legal says nothing as to its validity. I mean having to fall back on free speech as an argument does nothing to prove you right.\n\nEDIT 2: I now feel that an argument for, or against someone's right to a viewpoint has no bearing on the validity of the viewpoint.

By that I mean, just because I was able to make it out of the 'hood' doesn't necessarily mean every black person is awarded that opportunity. \n\n\nHowever I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight. \n\nObviously I'm not going to be able to go into deep analysis of my views but I'll try touch on some view points.\n\n* Mindset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack people throughout American history have been disproportionately impoverished, and throughout the last 30 years have developed a mindset of \"hustlin\". Now I understand that \"hustlin\" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5, I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. \"Hustlin'\"  is glorified while education is not. \n\nThere is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. \n\nHip-hop is attached to black culture, and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite, but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us &amp; crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this, everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy, and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. \n\nBlack people want to be included in mainstream society, yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises, but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too. America works best as a soup, not a salad. \n\nThe black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\n/r/blackpeopletwitter, albeit funny, is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape, 'bruh' 'nigga this, nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying \"nigga\" and \"bitch\" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\" \n\n\n* Black nationalism\n\nIn my eyes, black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.\n\ni.e. \"Ancient Egyptians were black, Jesus was black, Mohammed was black, etc\" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. \n\n\n* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny\n\nAs I stated earlier, the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV. \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "Wow, there is a lot to respond to here.  I'll start out by tackling it point by point.\n\n&gt; There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty.\n\nFirst off, sports are actually one of the more genuinely meritocratic institutions in this country.  Although realistically most black people will never become professional athletes, sports in school often come with requirements to maintain a certain GPA, and there are a variety of scholarships that colleges offer for athletes.  This is a minor nitpick, but it's not wrong to suggest sports can help some black people out of poverty.\n\nBut that's a minor point.  More importantly, the idea that black people just don't value education is wrong.  Empirically, factually wrong.  [Here is a very interesting article on the subject](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html), discussing whether or not black people have a disdain for education and view it as \"acting white.\"  What the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts.  Black students were more likely to report that their friends wanted them to go to college, a majority of all black students personally plan to go to college, and by far the most common reason for not going was being unable to afford it.  Black people were even slightly more likely to consider high-achieving students \"cool\", and a greater proportion of black people said that their friends would be supportive if they received good grades than white people.  To quote the article:\n\n&gt; For more than three decades, researchers have found that black students consistently exhibit more positive attitudes about education than white students, contrary to their lower levels of academic achievement.\n\nThis raises the question about why black academic achievement is lower.  One possibility is that schools in black neighborhoods have much less funding and larger class sizes that make individualized attention difficult.  Another could be a feeling of being unsafe, which, the linked article notes, is correlated with decreased academic achievement.  \"Stereotype threat\", a phenomenon noted by Claude Steele and discussed at length in his book *Whistling Vivaldi*, describes the way anxiety about confirming a stereotype can result in worse performance on a given task.  Whatever the reason(s), it is not \"black culture\".\n\nNow, on to another argument of yours, OP:\n\n&gt; The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\nRates of violent crime are higher in black communities than white ones.  The problem is that viewing crime in the lens of \"personal responsibility\" or otherwise simply blaming criminals, punishing them, and calling it a day, is intellectually bankrupt and morally irresponsible.  And chalking it up to some vague \"black culture\" and then flooding the neighborhood with cops is certainly not a rational response.  Asking why black on black crime is a problem is a legitimate question, however.  Let's investigate.\n\nFirst, most violent crimes are intraracial- white people are generally more likely to kill other white people, and black people are generally more likely to kill other black people.  You've likely heard this point before so I won't spend much time on it.\n\nOf course, you can counter that black people still commit higher rates of violent crime, and you would be right.  However, the explanation is not as simple as \"black culture\".  [According to one study](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/623/1/93.short):\n\n&gt; Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.\n\n[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that \"gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (Figure 5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).\"  These critical community conditions?  Differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.\n\n[A different study](http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/93.short) finds that unemployment and underemployment are significantly correlated with willingness to commit crime.  [Black unemployment rates are consistently roughly twice white unemployment rates.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/)  [A white criminal and a black person without a criminal record have roughly the same chance of being hired.](http://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/)  It's nearly impossible for black people with criminal records to get jobs, and with the War on Drugs, large numbers of black people have been swept up into the criminal justice system as felons, and permanently denied access to the economy.  Between violent criminals and nonviolent drug offenders, 1/3 of black men will be incarcerated at some point in their lives, which means 1/3 of black men will be disadvantaged in finding employment, and more likely to commit crime as a result.\n\nYou say the black community needs to tackle black on black crime.  And I agree!  It needs to tackle black on black crime by addressing it at its sources- mass incarceration, poverty, lack of services, police brutality, and segregation.  But of course, we have movements dealing with those issues.  One such movement is #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nAnyway, moving on:\n\n&gt; The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\"\n\nIt is true that white people are often victims of police brutality and mass incarceration.  It's also true that black people are disproportionately victims of those things.  And another thing that is true: black people are more likely than white people to even acknowledge that a problem exists.  By calling attention to a problem white people largely don't want to realize exists, a problem born from post-civil rights movement racism masquerading as a concern for \"law and order\", of course BlackLivesMatter is going to be polarizing.  But it needs to be BlackLivesMatter because of the racist origins of our current system of mass incarceration, the disproportionate police brutality, and the havoc racism continues to inflict on black communities.  To ignore the racial aspects of our current police brutality problem is to fall short of being able to fix it and the system around it.",

Really helped with my perspective. \n\nEDIT 2: I've been awarding deltas to people whom have been making some very good, solid points...but then I get a message from the delta bot informing me that I didn't do it correctly. I just want you all to know that you have successfully changed my view! Thank you so much for all your insight, i really appreciate it.\n\n\nI watched the documentary on A-Sexualism and I'm not convinced. I think these people that identify as \"asexual\" either haven't found the 'right' person for them yet, are just looking for attention, or just joining part of a trend to seem 'interesting' or 'different'. I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans. I understand how this can be offensive. I look at my brother who is gay and I understand where he comes from, and the obstacles he overcomes through being gay, and I just can't sympathize with people who identify as 'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community. Please change my view! ",
        "argument": "Being asexual is definitely not a choice. While some kids may \"try on\" asexuality just like some kids experiment with bisexual or gay relationships in their early years, it's something that wears on you over time. If there is one solid expectation of you in society, it's that everyone wants to get laid. Sex is such an integral part of our relationships and our perceived value in relationships. Can you think of the last time you got aroused? Can you imagine *never* having been aroused? Isn't it such a strange thought?\n\nThat's how many asexuals feel about the idea of sexual attraction. It's *strange* and foreign. And because we have that powerful disconnect from something which is a strong underlying motivation for the human existence, we're constantly being judged in our relationships--from friendships, to family, and of course our partners as well. \n\nMany asexuals find the right person for them, but the relationship isn't viable because a sexual connection is very important for most people. Even if an asexual is willing to have sex, it's never going to be that powerful \"perfect fit\" sex that partners with good chemistry have. \n\nPeople are extremely uncomfortable at the idea of asexuality. It's definitely not something you can choose.\n\n\n####*personal anecdote follows*\n\n\nI'm 30 years old and asexual. This is a throwaway. I've come to strongly resent my asexuality at this point in my life. Maybe because I spent most of my life trying to ignore it, then trying to fix it, and then ultimately concluding that I am stuck with it.\n\nI've went my entire life and felt no physical attraction to another human being, and it's a really hard concept for a lot of people to understand. I've actually had my mother tell me \"I wish you were gay just so I could understand!\" and that's difficult to hear because that's right up there with being a satanist for her (conservative roots here).\n\nI think there is definitely some people that participate in sexual \"trends\" per se as they are growing older and finding their sexual identity. It's just a natural part of experimenting and finding out about your own body and what you like. Or, maybe people think because they've never been laid that they must clearly be asexual because that seems like a better club to be in than undesirable.\n\nYou really start noticing a gap between you and your friends very quickly, though. There's different shades of asexuality, but I remember so clearly being that weird kid who was completely uninterested in sex but that many people found very attractive. Emotionally, I can connect to other people like anyone else. While I didn't desire sex, I desired to make an emotional connection. So I dated... and dated, and dated. When I was young, I had the excuse that (being in a conservative area), I was waiting for marriage even though I wasn't religious at all. As you can imagine, though, this gets pretty old with young kids wanting to rut everywhere. I got talked about a lot, and not in a good way. \n\nAs an adult, I didn't really have any excuses anymore. I went to see sex therapists, regular therapists, doctors, and anyone else who would listen trying to fix myself. Medically, there's nothing wrong with me.\n\nI stopped dating for a long time. I came to realize that for most other people, sex was a necessary part of a relationship and that they couldn't feel connected without it. That thought was as alien to me as my lack of sexuality was to my boyfriends.\n\nI've been dating my fiance for three years now. Emotionally, we have a really powerful bond but physically I struggle. We do have sex, sometimes. It's tedious and unpleasant for me but I try to make it nice for him. I like cuddling afterwards because I feel like I've endured something that has brought us closer together. We both struggle with my asexuality because it's really hard for a partner to understand that there's nothing they can do to change it but it doesn't mean I don't love him. ",

I don’t really want to discuss this aspect of it, but it’s here for some background on my position.\n\n2.\tAbortion should be legal, based primarily on my foundational belief on bodily autonomy. To change my view, you will probably need to change my belief that the mother’s legal right to control her own body overrides the fetus’ (or child’s) right to use them.\n\nOne of the main objections to legal abortion is the sense that the woman has incurred a sort of responsibility to the child by engaging in sex (for this CMV, I’d prefer to only consider consensual sex). While this may be true, I see it at most to be a moral obligation, not a legal one. The best analogy I’ve heard is as follows:\n\n\nLet’s say you are driving recklessly and run over a pedestrian. The ambulance arrives and does a quick blood test and determines that unless you donate a pint of blood to that pedestrian, he will die. You hate needles and refuse. At the moment, you cannot be legally compelled to donate your blood. If you can’t be compelled to donate blood (which is almost completely safe) to save the life of someone he recklessly endangered, a woman should not be required to donate her internal organs for 9+ months to a fetus to keep it alive.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThere are probably other ways in which my view could be changed, but here is the conversation that changed my view first:\n\n/u/garnteller:\n&gt;So, let's say there was a teleporter accident that caused the second head. You knew it was a risk going in. It will take 9 months for science to clone a body to host the head. Are you still free to kill it?\n\nMy realization as I thought through the implications:\n&gt;This is again, a very difficult question and I had to put some thought into it before responding. Since we're into sci-fi land, lets look at the probable scenario:\n\n\n&gt;In a world where teleportation is a common mode of transport and head grafting was a possible (if somewhat uncommon) outcome, I wouldn't want to travel without knowing that whoever I traveled with (assuming these are the only people who get head-grafted) agreed to keep my head alive until my replacement body could be found. This would be a sort of additional agreement reached between the teleporters.\n\n\n&gt;Even in this scenario, I would be very hesitant make it a default law... but I could easily see that it could become that way if enough people used teleportation and the head-grafting continued to happen.\n\n\n&gt;So, I guess the short answer is that I am of the opinion that it should be possible to sign away a certain level of bodily autonomy to secure a level of personal safety. After all, you could be the grafted head next time.\nThis seems to severely impact my position, since an actual analogous scenario would be where the teleporter picks up a random person (who did not choose to teleport) and has their head grafted to their body.\nI guess if a fetus really is a person, it probably should be illegal to abort it.\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.\n\n  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries.

        "text": "In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? \n\nSex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. \n\nI can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. \n\nIf you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. \n\nAnd just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. \n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. \n\nSo, please. Change my view!

I'll quote: \n\n* In order to receive regulatory approval\nin the United States, each\nnew GM crop must be subjected to\nrigorous analysis and testing. It must\nbe shown to be the same as the parent\ncrop from which it was derived\nand if a new protein trait has been\nadded, the protein must be shown\nto be neither toxic nor allergenic.\nAs a result and contrary to popular\nmisconceptions, GM crops are the\nmost extensively tested crops ever\nadded to our food supply. \n\n* The World Health\nOrganization, the American Medical\nAssociation, the U.S. National Academy\nof Sciences, the British Royal\nSociety, and every other respected\norganization that has examined the\nevidence has come to the same\nconclusion: consuming foods containing\ningredients derived from GM\ncrops is no riskier than consuming\nthe same foods containing ingredients\nfrom crop plants modified by\nconventional plant improvement\ntechniques.\n\n&gt; We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness( especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem.\n\nIf you're implying that consuming GMO foods causes any of these diseases, then you're wrong.

THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground.\n\n1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.\n\nOnly The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status.  The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions.\n\n2) They care about more than just themselves.\n\nThe Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales.\n\n3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.\n\nTurkey is key here.  For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.  Now they're wringing their hands about how *powerless* they are to stop ISIS while they gleefully watch the black banner do all their dirty work for them, then step in with overwhelming force to rescue Ataturk's grave the moment it's threatened.

AI would help us be able to focus more on the expansion of our species into space.\n\n2. **Entertainment** My biggest disagreement with the CGP video is how he frames the idea of entertainers being replaced by AI. Sure, they can write beautiful music, but how much is recorded music going for right now, anyway? And people enjoy watching PEOPLE perform. There's nothing particularly beautiful about an arabesque, but what's beautiful is watching a person do it. Same with acting, singing, sports, etc.\n\n3. **Engineering**: This one seems pretty simple. It'll be a long time (in theory) before we can automate robots that can out engineer us. \n\n4. **Cyber Protection** This is the biggest one.

I have torrented rarely for probably 5 years, but I would consider myself on the bottom end of piracy. I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime and Spotify, and usually buy my games on steam. Because of these services I never pirate music or games ever, and I usually do not pirate Television or Movies either.\n\nAs an aspiring filmmaker myself, it feels hypocritical to steal someone else's hard work, and so if at all possible I do not do that. I am more than willing to pay 3-5 dollars to rent a movie I want to watch. But this is not the internet we live in. While some movies are available on youtube, itunes and amazon instant for rental, many are either only available to buy or not available at all. On top of that, these services tend to have a charge to rent the \"HD\" version of the film, a practice I believe to be archaic and stupid in an age where everyone has HD monitors and/or TVs. \n\nIn my mind, if there were a service that made a huge selection of films available for a one-time viewing for $5 easily and at full quality -- with options for downloading if need be -- I personally would never pirate films or TV. \n\nHowever, this may not represent the consumer base as a whole and may not be enough to save the companies afraid of the internet. \n\n(WARNING: I AM GOING OFF WHAT I HAVE READ IN THIS SECTION -- I DO NOT HAVE SOURCES FOR MY CLAIMS YET) \n\nWhile Spotify does seem mitigate piracy, it also does not give much money to artists as a rule. But, at the same time, most artists make their money from touring and not from album sales, as the record label would end up taking most of the money from itunes/CD sales anyways. So part of me thinks that in this open age that perhaps it is the companies that should fail, if they cannot accept the internet's existence, freeing the artists to receive more money for sales directly from services such as Spotify and iTunes. The same applies to movies, television (which Netflix has helped a lot, I think) and games (I don't know many people who pirate games, since they are readily available on Steam and GOG.com as a rule) as well.\n\nTL;DR -- I think the companies fighting piracy should give up and try to mitigate it instead -- adapt rather than fight. \n\nWhat do you think?

But here is the thing: It isn't limited to women, and it's much more broad than you think. Humans are all creatures with skills and needs. In order to create bonds with other humans, you need a skill that fits with that human's needs.\n\nThis can be something as simple as a mutual need for companionship, or as complex as a company's desire to pay money for someone to do upkeep on their servers that run on a very specific set of software that you happen to know how to use.\n\nThe thing about women isn't that they all have this list of things to be attracted to. A woman being attracted to you is not (necessarily) about how much you earn or how handsome you are. It's about how interested you can make her with your unique attributes.\n\nAs an exercise: what makes you special? If I were a girl, interviewing you for the job of boyfriend, what would make you stand out, and what would you say makes you a better applicant?\n\nNow, a harder exercise: What do you do that shows that externally? It's a pretty good bet that most people can't read your mind, so if you want the world to know that (for instance) you're cool and confident, or that you are a world-class singer, or that you are exceptionally nice (not the general \"nice\" that means bland, but that you care about humanitarian causes and do something to fix them), then the onus is on you to show that outwardly.\n\nAs an anecdote, here are some things that I have done that have led to some form of romantic or sexual involvement:\n\n* Told jokes\n\n* Juggled\n\n* Played guitar (badly)\n\n* Taught someone how to play a non-\"conventional\" board game (Arkham Horror, in case you cared)\n\n* Had the confidence to ask if they would go out with me (this should really be near the top of the list), and then didn't freak out if the answer was no (I've actually experienced this: one girl accepted after I didn't make a big deal of a \"no\").\n\n* Recited the quadratic equation from memory.\n\nI'm sure I can think of others, but the point remains that all of that had not much to do with my ability to provide for them or how handsome I was (and I'm a fat nerd, so I'm not really traditionally good-looking).

My mother has lived in Canada for almost twenty years now and she still has trouble sometimes. My view is that all immigrants should strive for at the very least an [intermediate](http://www.londonschool.com/level-scale/) mastery. \n\n* My one exception would be if an immigrant does not have the financial capability to pay for lessons in the language of the country they've moved to. However, in Canada at least, free English lessons are offered to new immigrants, so I wouldn't see any reason to not learn the language here. \n\nNot learning the primary language of the country they've moved to encourages segregation and often leads to racial or cultural tension. By refusing to learn the primary language to an acceptable extent, they're showing a blatant refusal to adapt even a little to their new country's culture. Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt. What's the point of coming all the way to another country if you're not going to respect it?

        "title": "CMV:All states should adopt laws similar to the \"Idaho Stop Law\" with regards to people riding bikes",
        "text": "**Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one disputing my included claim that bicycles are more capable of maneuvering a rolling stop than cars, and one for a caveat that municipalities should have the option of restricting the law in certain zones where the dangers would outweigh the benefits. Continue the conversation! I'm ready for bed.** \n\n*This has been argued before, but the most recent iteration I could find was two months ago and I believe because:*\n\n*1. it is part of a major national ongoing discussion in transportation circles, and*\n\n*2. the post of two months ago used different reasoning than my own,* \n\n*It is worth revisiting*\n\n**Background**: Idaho Statute 49-720, commonly known as the \"Idaho Stop Law\" or \"Idaho Yield Law\" is legislation allowing legal exemptions from stop signs and stop lights for people riding bicycles that was adopted in 1982. The full law can be read [here](http://legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title49/T49CH7SECT49-720.htm) for those interested. Paraphrased, the law states that any bicyclist approaching a stop sign must slow their speed and check for cross traffic, but may proceed without stopping if it is safe to do so. Additionally, bicyclists approaching a stop light must come to a full stop (defined as a \"halt of forward momentum\") and may proceed through the light forward or by turning onto a cross street in either direction if it is safe to do so and the bicyclist does not impede cross traffic.\n\n**My reasoning**: Having lived in Idaho (among many other places both densely urban and vastly rural) and having used a bicycle as my primary means of transportation for nearly 20 years in those areas, I believe the Idaho Stop, if implemented correctly, is not only the best compromise for all forms of traffic that share the roads, but is actually *beneficial* to all road users.\n\nThere are many reasons the law is beneficial to cyclists, from their perspective (taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop#Positions)):\n\n* Because of the positive externalities of cycling, bicycle laws should be designed to allow cyclists to travel swiftly and easily, and this provision allows for the conservation of energy.\n* Current laws were written for cars, and unlike cars, it is easy for cyclists to yield the right-of-way without coming to a complete stop.\n* Because cyclists are moving slower, have stereoscopic hearing, have no blind spots and can stop and maneuver more quickly than cars, current traffic control device laws don't make sense for cyclists.\n* With the Idaho stop, at special intersections where lights are controlled by sensing equipment, there is no need to provide extra equipment for cyclists. *(This is a big problem)*\n* The usual law forces cyclists to choose between routes that are more efficient but less safe due to higher traffic volumes, and routes that are safer, but less efficient due to the presence of numerous stop signs. Allowing cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs empowers them to legally make the safer routes more efficient.\n\nThese are all logical benefits to the cyclist. As such, they should be taken into account when making decisions regarding traffic infrastructure improvements. However, give the overwhelming task of replacing/improving infrastructure long since built primarily for motor vehicles, cyclists of my generation and probably the following as well require some compromises to be able to use the streets safely and efficiently as legal vehicles (yes, bikes are considered vehicles every bit as much as cars in every state.)\n\nThat said, I believe the strongest two arguments for why the Idaho Stop makes sense right now is not the benefit it provides to the cyclist exclusively, but the benefit it is to traffic flow in general. \n\n**1. Allowing bicyclists to proceed through intersections during red lights or at stop signs when it is safe to do so greatly reduces the number of bicycle riders who slow the flow of traffic through intersections.** \n\n**2. By allowing cyclist to get in front of traffic, they become more visible, and in so doing, safer.**\n\nThe Idaho Stop allows bicycles to remove themselves from the acceleration phase of a traffic cycle, when the speed discrepancy is highest between bicycles and motor vehicles, while simultaneously allowing the cyclist as a small, slow moving vehicle to move to the front of traffic making them more visible to all road users. [The only study done on the topic in Idaho](http://bclu.org/jmeggs-TRB-IDAHO-AUG10.pdf)(pdf warning) found the latter claim to be true as the number of injuries to bicycle riders in the year after implementation dropped by 14.5%, with no increase in fatalities. As for the traffic flow improvement claim, I have nothing to offer other than anecdotal evidence from myself and fellow cyclists who have practiced the law. I would be open to reading any studies demonstrating evidence to the contrary if they exist.\n\n**Conclusion**: Ultimately, I believe the best solution for all parties is separated infrastructure for cyclists akin to what is found in the Netherlands and other bicycle-friendly European countries, such as protected bike lanes, cycletracks, and protected intersections. Many jurisdictions in the U.S.A. are moving toward implementing these necessary improvements, but timelines for such a massive restructuring of traffic flow and accompanying reeducation period stretch on, quite literally, for a lifetime. Timeline projects for some projects are on the scale of 50 years. In the meantime, I believe people who chose to ride bicycles for practical purposes ought to be encouraged and protected in doing so and the Idaho Stop Law is the best example of a working compromise available while we continue to work toward a more permanent solution.\n\nI feel strongly about this argument and have spent years debating it, but I am always open to having my view changed if the right argument arises that I haven't considered. CMV?\n\nEDIT 1: A huge caveat required to make this practical is a strong educational program to accompany the law change wherever it is affected. Schools, news organizations, government agencies, and police would have to cooperate to educated all road users about the change. It is happening in Boise right now, and can be done.\n\nEDIT 2: A good number of responses are arguing that bicyclists already break laws and this would make them more likely. Contrarily, what has been seen in Boise is that with the advent of the law, police are free to ignore bicyclists behaving in law-abiding and safe manner, and freed up to target those who are actually putting others in danger. There is nothing inherent in the law that legalizes hitting pedestrians or cutting off cross traffic, and violators who do that can more easily be identified and appropriately cited.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.\n\n\nPoint 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx\nThe ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.\n\nPoint 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.\n\nPoint 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. \n\nPoint 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.",
        "argument": "It's worth noting that many elderly African Americans were born outside of hospitals due to Segregation, and were never given birth certificates.  Many African Americans also have names misspelled or birthdays wrongly listed on birth certificates.

It seems particularly cruel that a group that's only been able to vote for 50 years will now have to jump through hoops, bureaucracy, and complicated paperwork to exercise this right. \n\nI disagree that free ID cards is a low cost/high benefit solution.  Hundreds of millions of dollars spent to combat a non-existent voter fraud problem seems like a high cost for no benefit.  Furthermore, it doesn't solve the early voting/absentee voting fraud potential, which probably is a much easier and safer way to commit voter fraud.  \n\nFinally, lines at voting stations could be fixed by hiring more employees or opening more stations.  These long lines are often blamed on partisan decisions to intentionally suppress low income and minority votes, and this problem wouldn't necessarily go away with more IDs.  ",

But for government to come in when a dying person passes on their belongings or money to someone they care about and snatch away a piece of it is a step too far.\n\nI am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax.

They aim do this by gaining power through an election. The leader of the party is the face of the party to the public, as well as the leading force of the parties visions, views and how they conduct themselves. If the electorate rejects the party at an election, the leader may stand aside to give someone else a more likely chance of gaining power and brining about positive change. As clearly the public does not have faith in the party with them at the helm. In the modern era with 24 hour news coverage this is much more true now than it was before. It could be argued that a real power play would try to stay in for as many election cycles as you can get away with before being ousted. \n\nThe Labour and Liberal Democrats suffered bad losses that reflected poorly on the party and their leadership. If the leaders had stayed on through this the public would have viewed them as desperate and a spent force around the time of the next election. In order for the party to bounce back as quickly as possible and start moving itself in the right direction, they will step aside. \n\nYou must also remember that the leaders you mentioned have been members of their parties from probably 16/18 years old. They dedicated their entire lives to the party so it's fair to say they may take the view that stepping down will be in the best interests of the party if not their own interests. ",

        "text": "Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.\n\nI realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.\n\nKnowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?\n\nEdit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information. Also, a side note, this is one of my very first posts and, by miles, my most commented on one.

I think it all boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, and how quickly you like to add music to your library.\n\nUsing iTunes is free, but you have to pay about a dollar, give or take, for each song (less per song if you purchase an album). With Spotify Premium, you pay $5 per month for unlimited songs. So, if you regularly add more than five songs a month (which I do) then Spotify is definitely worth the fee. The crux of this issue is that it doesn't matter how many songs you *already have in your library*, but *how often you add new ones*.\n\nAlthough I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Spotify has a free version (if you can stomach the drawbacks) which offers most of the same benefits. Theoretically unlimited music library for free - hard to beat that.",

Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements.

The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88% in preventing serious injury. About 70-80% of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries.

        "text": "In the early 90s Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved in the \"Velvet Divorce\" into two separate countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I like that they split the name evenly as well.  They divided the national assets by population and want their respective ways.  While there have been some hiccups, by and large both countries are doing fine. \n\nI think America should undergo a Velvet Divorce of its own.  First the how, then the why. I'd like to focus on why it's a worse outcome than the current course of the country, rather than on the problems with execution (which are admittedly huge).\n\nThe How:\nEach political party designs a policy platform for their own country.  Everyone votes in a \"primary\" referendum for the various platforms, and the two platforms with the most votes advance to the general referendum. Based on the current U.S. political situation, Democratic and Republican platforms are likely to win top-two. (If we want to do more, we can, but it seems like 3rd parties would still benefit)\n\nIn the general referendum, every state holds a vote between the two platforms. The majority decides which country the state will join. \n\nThe likely countries we'll call the \"United States\" and \"America\". These are short-hand for the more liberal/Democratic country and the more conservative/Republican country, respectively. They're likely to look somewhat similar to the last few presidential elections, though with perhaps some defectors in either direction, depending on which country the states see as the real successor to the USA. \n\nFor five years, the government plans and executes the division of itself, the national assets, and national debts by population.  Anyone who wants to move from an area that will be in one country, to an area that will\nbe in the other, will receive government assistance to move.  (I would predict an exodus of African-Americans from \"America\")\n\nAt the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states. \n\nThe Why:\nIt's apparent to even casual observers of American politics that The USA is a nation divided, mired in gridlock. The result is a non-functional government in which no one is satisfied and major policy initiatives are tortured into Frankensteinian monstrosities to pass (Obamacare). \n\nAmericans have already begun to segregate themselves politically and we've seen a real deterioration of moderate politicians in both parties, who normally could help bridge the gap and find compromises.  \n\nThis stagnation is hurting the USA both at home and abroad. Significant domestic policy challenges are going unaddressed on the federal level (climate change, loss of the middle class, deterioration of transportation infrastructure, tax reform, cost of higher education) and as a result, the USA is losing ground against other countries economically. \n\nSo instead of constantly tripping over each other, screwing up each other's plans, etc, why not divorce?  The \"United States\" can try every left-wing wacko policy it wants, \"America\" can finally do all the nutbag conservative things it wants, and in thirty years, we see which country is the better for it?  Could it really be worse than the partisan gridlock that is dragging the USA down?\n\nProblems with this idea:\nThere are a lot, so I'll highlight some big ones on the procedure side and the effect side. \n\nMilitary:  Each nation would be nuclear-capable and have procedures and armaments the other side is familiar with. This means duplication of key assets (two NORADs, two Pentagons) and that new procedures will have to be developed to ensure neither has the advantage over the other. The \"United States\" might also suffer significance military brain drain to \"America\" due to the average political inclinations of service members. \n\nWorld Economy:  The world economy would go into recession as the world's biggest economy divides and both countries struggle with the inherent inefficiency of two economies where there was one.  Especially if either side enacts trade barriers to the other. \n\nRace to the bottom:  \"America\" would probably remove or reduce labor, environmental, and health and safety laws that are considered bad for business, making it more attractive for capital investment.  This would undermine the \"United States\"economy and progressive policies, as companies can get the same workers for cheaper. \n\nGeography:\n\"America\" would be continuous and vaguely similar to the Republican \"L\" of the south and midwest, with the \"United States\" split between the west coast and northeast.  This is not conducive to the survival of the \"United States\" as an intact entity, I'm not sure there's a nation that's been divided into two parts that has survived very long. ",
        "argument": "The problem is that we aren't divided on a nice and neat state level. Have you seen the [Purple America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_America) map? You can have liberal districts (often but not always containing cities) inside of states that strongly disagree with them, or conservative districts (often but not always more rural) inside states that are seen as liberal, and even beyond that things can be close (shades of purple instead of bright red and blue).\n\nSo for example Northwest Oregon would want to be part of the \"United States,\" but as soon as you get outside of the Multonomah/Clackamas region and Lane county the state would probably want to be \"America.\" This is pretty common throughout the country, with bastions of one side or the other even inside \"strongholds.\" What determines how the state goes isn't geographic, but based on how large the populations of the two parts happen to be. The same goes for a county.\n\nIf we are dividing at the state level they will end up in the wrong ones, and after some adjustment likely get back to the sort of gridlock we have. If you divide at the district level you will have a total mess, with enclaves surrounded by other countries and going back and forth between two countries ever county line!\n\nSo while the current situation might be far from ideal, break wouldn't even be as clean as many of the country breakups have been in the past along historic/ethnic lines that have a strong geographic element.

        "title": "CMV: Prescriptivism",
        "text": "I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as \"correct\" language, that what prescriptivists call \"mistakes\" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.\n\nLinguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single \"correct\" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly \"incorrect\" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.\n\nBut. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any \"correct\" language. For example:\n\n\"He _went_ to the shops\"\n\"He _gone_ to the shops\"\n\nI can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of \"go\" is \"gone\" instead of \"went\". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:\n\n\"Shops went the he to\"\n\nThis isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than \"incorrect\"? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.\n\nSo what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as \"wrong\".

        "title": "CMV: Common Core (esp. Mathematics) is a system that is fundamentally flawed and does not prepare students for the real world.",
        "text": "To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out.\n\nLet's take the [Common Core Algebra standards](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction/) as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics.\n\nI believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1981_AHSME_Problems#Problem_30) Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking.\n\nLet's take [Geometry for another example.](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/introduction/) If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason.\n\nIt’s also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh/3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this.\n\nSo far, I’ve touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that’s the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn’t be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn’t the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn’t be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great.\n\nI’ll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it’s effective. Please CMV.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I think reasoning is much more important than having formulas memorized for the real world.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that what you make will be enough to live off of, so it's probably just safer to get a real job.\n\nFor Youtube, it seems like you need to be the following to be successful:\n\n* A young attractive person (or at least a person with an attractive voice) that appeals to some major demographic (teenage girls, LGBT teens, sports fans, etc.)\n\n* Someone who was already famous on a different social medium\n\n* A Let's Player\n\nAnd in all of these, you need a certain budget to spend on making your videos (light, camera, a crew maybe?) and that's not including the money you need for specific videos (e.g. a Let's Player needs enough money to buy new/big budget games in order to attract attention, a make-up channel needs to buy TONS of products, clothing channels need to shop on a regular basis, etc.).\n\nTwitch has the same problems as a Youtube Let's Player; in order to be noticed, you need to buy really popular games and/or new games, and those are rarely cheap; most games are up in the $60+ range, not including DLC or even the equipment needed to stream at a constant frame-rate for long periods of time. \n\nEven if you DO get popular on either of these platforms and get a partnership, Twitch takes half of your subscription profits, leaving you mostly depending on possible donations, and Youtube takes a lot of your ad revenue (not including other Youtube-related partnerships you might have [cough cough Nintendo cough]). \n\nIf you ABSOLUTELY need to make money on one of these platforms, or a similar platform, then you should either be rich or have had a real job long enough that you have enough money to survive.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "This is very much like a career in acting. You could say: well only a lucky few get to perform in movies. But the truth is, luck often has very little to do with it.\n\n1: You most certainly do not need to be an attractive person to get an audience. Sure, it might help a bit, but there are plenty of examples which say otherwise. Take for example boogie2988. He is a big overweight person with 2.5 million subscribers. He is a lot of things, but I do not think his viewerbase thinks he is attractive on the appearance side of things.\n\n2: Neither is it important to be famous from other media. Sure it helps out greatly, but it is no more than a kickstart. The real reason for their career lies in something else, which I shal expend on in the final paragraphs. Take for example again boogie2988, or as a fresh example lindsey stirling. Lindsey Stirling is a musician, who became famous through youtube. She made some excellent music, and gained a fair share of subscribers. She became famous because someone entered her in the King of the web contest, and she went from a youtube musician to someone touring all over the world. Marketing and skill are key.\n\n3: While let's players have an easier time, because half of the content is made for them, there are plenty of other examples of people who became big without let's plays. In the top 100 youtube subscriber list, there are plenty of examples. Many music channel, or things like epic mealtime, prankvsprank or ERB (epic rap battles).\n\n\nSo let's start talking about what made them succesfull in the first place. There are 3 big things which in my opinion get you a career in youtube/streaming\n\n1: skill. The same reason why professional sports is one of the most watched media. The ability to do what millions of others cannot. The reason why so many league of legend channels are so big, is because the game has a large playerbase, and those players love watching the absolute top. It may not always be able to achieve this for everyone, but let me say that the top 50 Starcraft 2 players practise a lot.\n\n2: following up on that is the most important section: dedication. Starting a channel or stream takes a lot of time. The mistake many people make is that they stream for maximum 2 hours, finally have 3 viewers and stop streaming. People attract people, and even the bigger streamers don´t achieve their mx viewers until hours after starting.\n\nThis also goes for youtube. If you can only post 1 quality video every 2 weeks, you channel is not interesting enough. The ability to be a consistant source of entertainment is important. Lethalfrag is an example of someone who made it into streaming. He saved his money so he didnt need income for a year, and went all/out streaming. He started from nothing, but since he was entertaining and going the entire year, he achieved his goal, and could sustain himself. Boogie2988 has been youtubing for over 9 years now, he never gave up on the early hurdles.\n\n3: charismatic. Just like acting you need some skills. Give viewers a good reason to watch you over those other 200 channels. Although not my taste, a channel like pewdiepie knows what fanbase he has, and how to entertain them. stand out from others.\n\nso to conclude. Yes, making money (enough to sustain yourself) only happens to a few. But those are not the lucky few, those are the people with the dedication (mostly) and skill (secondary) to really go for it. It is a lot like acting. Sure getting a real job is safer, but your work is more than just income. I rather be barely surviving doing the thing i love, than being filthy rich and doing what i hate for 9 hours a day.",

        "text": "To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.\n\n1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.\n\n2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook?\n\n3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality\n\nOf course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "argument": "To be honest, I don't think there is a good answer to this one that doesn't ultimately boil down to having the cake and eating it too. The only thing that really makes sense as a response to this is that feminism is, at it's core, about advancing women's issues. The logical framework for advancing that idea is that everyone should be equal, but it is about making progress on issues where women are disadvantaged in some way to men, so your 3rd point isn't all that relevant; feminists might agree, in theory, that there are some areas where men are disadvantaged but they are not going to advocate for those issues to any noticeable extent because that isn't what the movement is about. You have to remember that feminism has a very large political/agend-ized component to it and the ultimate goal isn't to be as ideologically consistent as possible with regards to \"equality\", which is why you don't see feminists going to bat for \"men's rights\" issues. There is a reason why many feminists prefer to be called feminist than egalitarian; the focus is on women's issues. ",

If I wanted to be totally correct, I would have to say: \"My shirt is a color that very nearly approximates black.\" (Disproving this would be a very easy way to CMV!)\n\nThere are enough black-colored items in the world for this to be ridiculous. Thus, it's only logical that when we are casually talking to other humans, and mention the word 'black,' it can be assumed that we're referring to this close-enough faux-black, which does reflect (I'd assume) some light, and thus is totally a color. \n\nThe argument for white follows similarly.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that it's wrong to say that black and white aren't colors.

Whether they are doing it to decrease chances of accidents or they are revenue raising, the power still lies completely in the hand of the person behind the wheel.\n\nEven if the police had the intention of revenue raising, that money still goes toward hiring more officers, putting more police cars on the road and getting better technology to combat road accidents. They aren't making anyone speed, they are just making the best of the fact that people are going to speed, so they might as well bring some revenue in from it.\n\nEdit: I should have clarified that I am referring exclusively to traffic offences eg. Speeding, drink driving etc.\n\nEdit: My view has been changed.\n\nI now see that the motivations behind revenue raising contradict the motivations that the police service is created to have.

What if the driver going 70 kills someone right after? Would you hold the police force responsible for this? Technically they pulled over a safer driver for an opportunity to make more money. \n\nThink about how much this kind of behavior could hurt society: In business we call optimizing our resources to make the most money in certain areas *targeting*. This is a kind of discrimination, but because businesses do not have a moral or legal obligation to market their services to the whole population, there is nothing wrong with it. However, police forces are expected to offer their services to the whole population without discrimination, economic included.

The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  \n\nAfter realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.\n\nAm I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?\n\n***EDIT****\nFrom todays conversations:\nI see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.\n\nHowever, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.\n\nMany (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.\n\nIf he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough \"nation,\" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  \n\nThis is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).\n\nIt would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!",

I'm saying that it might make sense for individuals in very specific situations to vote. If the election appears to be especially close in terms of electoral votes (take the 2000 election for example), and your particular state has been polling at near equal support (Florida or New Mexico), then the probability of your vote making a difference could exceed 1 in 70,000. Depending on a person's valuation of costs and potential benefits, this could very well be enough for them to vote.",

So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

        "text": "One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented](http://www.criticalreview.com/crf/pdfs/klein_stern.pdf) in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Not only does this make people with conservative political views feel unwelcome and unappreciated in the university environment, it threatens the perceived validity of the research done. [This is even recognized by some leftists themselves](https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/right-wing-study-of-inequality/). How are you supposed to have valid research, let alone critical thinking, when there is an absolute hegemony of leftist views, which no one dares challenge due to their overwhelmingly disproportionate power and influence on campus? Therefore, to make university a more diverse environment and encourage critical thinking, we should prioritize student and faculty applicants who are affiliated with right wing organizations, and ensure that peer review panels have at least one right wing professor on them CMV.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "It's not just the Social Sciences that are dominated by the Left. The majority of *all* sciences skew towards the left rather than the right. \n\nI mean, the decision to be an academic has many qualities that appeal more to a Liberal than a Conservative.\n\n1. For example, why would a highly educated and talented scientist rather work as a researcher post-doc with dismal pay, rather than find a high-paying industry job? Because he is less motivated by the size of the salary but more-so by the perceived value of the work he does. Certain kinds of people would rather do poorly paid University Research. Republicans are obsessed with minimizing taxes to maximize your personal income. Is it surprising that Republicans elect to take a higher paying industry job rather than stay in lower-paying academia? \n\n\n2. Moreover, graduate schools are dominated by foreign-born students coming to America as a pathway to citizenship. At my state university, the vast majority of grad-students were foreigners, and the faculty was too. Is it particularly surprising that a multicultural faculty is hostile towards US White Conservatism? Perhaps then the very reason why Academia is Left-dominated is precisely because of *diversity*. Of course professors will be angry at pro-white, anti-multiculturalist rants, when their demographics are much more multicultural than the larger US population!\n\nAs far as you know, most faculties may already have ideologically-based affirmative action programs in place. American universities are obviously not structurally homogeneous. Unfortunately, the talent pool of willing applicants may be so small that finding a qualified Conservative is nearly impossible. Just look at the stereotype of a Liberal arts graduate student! Do you really suppose a mainstream Conservative man will spend 5 years of his life on a PhD history thesis without salary? Will the typical Conservative stereotype elect to study the social sciences?\n\n\nFinally, let's not forget the irony that affirmative-action-for-Republicans would fly against the face of Republican politics and ideology. Universities hire academics that can produce lots and lots of viable papers. Publish or perish. Moreover, Universities such as Harvard are private institutions that \"ought to\" do whatever the fuck they want. According to Republican political positions, ideologically-based affirmative action ought not be allowed. Positions should be given solely on merit - or in the Academic's case - their ability to generate vast amounts of research papers and bring prestige to the University. Conservatives should not be allowed into academia for the exact reason why Blacks or Latinos or other affirmative action'ed classes should not be allowed in - because they simply could not compete and do not have the necessary merit to be chosen.\n\nConservative professors should not be coddled by affirmative action, or they shall grow lazy and incompetent!

        "text": "If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?\n\nEdit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view.",
        "argument": "I'm an evolutionary ecologist by profession and I can provide a little perspective here that may change your view.   \n   \nIf you happen to be a person attempting to change OP's view that is.   \n    \nPopulation growth is one of those things that's pretty well understood. There are a few ways for populations to change in numbers and the most basic is exponential growth. That's how human population is changing.   \nBut, when that's how populations change, they will hit what OP called a 'growth cap'. We call this 'carrying capacity' and mathematically it's represented as K.   \n           \nWhat follows here will potentially get a little farther than necessary into  the ecology of the issue, but I think it's necessary to fully explain the situation our species faces in the next few hundred years.    \n\n     \n        \nCarrying capacity and population growth (r/K selection):     \n\nCheck out Fig. 5 in [this link](http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/an-introduction-to-population-growth-84225544)    \n    \nOn that graph there is a place on the x-axis marked K.   \n   \nThat graph is a line that represents how a population would grow under normal conditions. Meaning that it isn't growing exponentially, it's growing logistically.    \nK is the carrying capacity of the habitat. It's the number of individuals of a species that can be supported by the habitat.   \n   \nK-selected animals would have a population around K. They have stable populations and relatively low mortality and will generally hover right around where they should be.     \n     \nThey are called K-selected because they are selected for populations right around the carrying capacity.    \n     \nr-selected species are 'rate-selected'. So they are selected to be growing at a maximal rate. That's because they are usually something like mice that will have huge mortality, so the individuals are all pumping out as many offspring as possible.     \n    \nr-selected organisms will generally have a population right around K/2. That's because that's where the slope of that line is steepest, so that's where it's growing fastest.      \n     \n(Edit: To clarify, each species would have a different graph. So the mouse would have a different graph from the cat. The mouse population would be at K/2 for the mice, not K/2 for the cats.)\n     \n**Now check out Fig 8.**   \nThat's human population since the advent of agriculture. Notice it's not a logistic growth curve. Our population is growing exponentially. That's because we're K-selected, but we haven't reached K yet.     \nWhen we reach K what's going to happen is that we'll exceed it. When a population is growing like ours it will exceed K, then there will be famine, disease, death, real apocalyptic shit. That will drop the population well below K. The population will then start to rebound and go towards K again. The it will exceed it again and fall again. But this time the rise above K will be smaller and when it falls again it won't fall as far below K. It will sort-of oscillate about K for a while then level out and hover around K.     \n     \nProblem with human population growth is that we are destroying all of the habitat that would define K. So we're not just exponentially going for K, we're also dragging K towards us. And in the end, when we reach K, we may well have lowered that bar far further than 7 billion.   \n   \nAt least one well known researcher has predicted that our species will not last long enough for sea level rise to be any kind of issue. This person is in part responsible for wiping out small-pox and [he gives](http://phys.org/news/2010-06-humans-extinct-years-eminent-scientist.html) our species no more than 100 years until we are extinct.

        "text": "Throwaway account, my main is used for school.  \n\nI'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference.\n\nLet me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared.\n\nHere are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them:\n\n* More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough.\n\n* Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100% sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them.\n\n* Added financial benefit / tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 50/50. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat.\n\n\nNow here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response:\n\n\n* Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over $10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me.\n\n\n* Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 50/50 chance of going through exactly what my late father did.\n\n\nI hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her.  I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage.\n\nPlease, try to change my view - and thank you.\n\nEdit 1:  Whoever you are, thank you for mass-downvoting all my responses.  I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and if I'm frustrating you I don't mean anything negative by it.\n\nEdit 2:  Thank you all for your insight.  I have awarded one delta on this topic but for the most part I have not been convinced that marriage is for me.  Consider this CMV closed, although I may check back later to respond to any trailing opinions.\n\nI appreciate your time, and thank you very much.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

        "argument": "Marriage is an emotional commitment more than anything. Reason can pull you both ways, either into it for financial and legal reasons (tax cuts, if there was ever an accident you'd be legally recognized as next of kin, etc.) or out of it for practicality reasons. Unless you're religious and/or you desire offspring, marriage is something that can be easily considered trivial.\n\n\nThat said, I can see how your experience with divorce has colored your views, and rightly so. But you need to not let fear of a single potential outcome determine your approach to something. Especially if that something is a thing that someone you consider precious would like as part of her future.\n\n\nConsider for a moment what marriage in the modern day is... In truth, it's just legally recognized love. That is to say that if you love this girl, and you're already committed to her wholly, then you're emotionally already married but without the tax cuts, the legal recognition, and the failsafe should things go sour (divorce court). \n\n\nAnd as an aside, as many have said, the expense of a wedding is not something that needs to be a concern unless it's of personal concern to you both. Personally, my husband and I bought wooden rings off Etsy (his was $60, mine was $200 because it's ebony from Isreal), and we eloped. The expense? The price of the marriage license and the fuel to get it. And let me tell you, I have zero regrets about that, it was exactly how we wanted it when we wanted it. \n\n\nAnd a little bonus, people like giving wedding gifts. We set up a GoFundMe page because we didn't want gifts, but cash, and ended up coming out with over a grand in gift money. So it's not all bad =)",

Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. Corporate interests will pile the money on.
