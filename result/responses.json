        "prompt": "Original Post(OP)'s title: CMV: trying a child as an adult makes the protections offered to children irrelevant and is downright vengeful\nOriginal Post(OP)'s text: This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are!\n\nJuveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,\n\nTrying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?\n\nEDIT:\nI think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].\n\nAlso, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.\n\n\n[1] http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24173194 \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\nArgument: There are some acts that are simply so egregious, so heinous, and so evil that juveniles, as properly understood, simply do not commit them. Some of those acts would include murder or rape. Juveniles tend to commit acts that are more misdemeanor, trivial, or immature, like stealing a pack of gum from a convenience store. \n\nSo, how do we account for the fact some underage persons have in fact committed egregious acts like murder and rape? By concluding that these underage persons are not in fact juveniles, and probably haven't been for some time, because juveniles simply do not have the capacity to rape or murder someone. Their capacity to commit evil acts, assuming they're guilty of what they're charged, is on par with an adult, and the legal system treats them accordingly. I see nothing unfair with such a system.\n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view. Respond with 'positive' if it has and 'negative' if it has not.\n\nBased on the above information, please give me your answer following these guidelines:\n1. You should provide your explanation before you respond with the prediction.\n2. Your prediction should be explicitly stated as 'positive' or 'negative'.\n\nThe response is:",
        "response": "Explanation: This argument states that juveniles who commit crimes usually associated with adults, such as rape or murder, should be treated as adults since juveniles do not typically have the capacity to commit such acts. It suggests that their ability to commit such actions indicates they are more mentally and emotionally mature, like an adult, and should therefore be treated as such in the court of law. This contrasts with the OP's view that trying a child as an adult undermines the protections given to children and is vengeful.\n\nPrediction: Negative. The argument still puts emphasis on the severity of the crime rather than considering age and experience which OP emphasized earlier in their post. Additionally, the OP believes in rehabilitation, which is not addressed in the counter-argument."

        "prompt": "Original Post(OP)'s title: CMV:Private business should be able to do or not do business with whoever they want.\nOriginal Post(OP)'s text: I believe that a private business should be able to deny service to anyone for any reason. For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, then they should be able to. As a private citizen, I can choose who I give my business to. If I'm a racist, I can choose to only give my business to my race.  If I personally want to give money to the homeless, I can choose to give it to one race/orientation/etc. or another. Why can't a private business make the same decision? The free market place should solve this problem because people would see a need to service those that are refused service and then start a competing business.\nArgument: &gt;Why can't a private business make the same decision?\n\nBecause, when we talk about businesses, we're usually talking about conglomerates that have formally incorporated in one way or the other.  Incorporation is a creature of statute; it's created by the government.  It's more reasonable for the government to attach strings on the benefits associated with incorporation than it is to you as an individual because they're giving the business some fancy treatment.\n\nThe government hasn't bestowed any peculiar status to you, personally.  It has bestowed a status upon most businesses, who are insulated from traditional personal liability, can choose from a myriad of different tax schemes, enter contracts as a business, and so on.\n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view.

You should provide your explanation before you respond with the prediction.\n2. Your prediction should be explicitly stated as 'positive' or 'negative'.\n\nThe response is:",
        "response": "The argument counters the original poster's view by explaining the distinction between an individual citizen's actions and those of a corporation. The commenter points out that corporations have legal protections and tax benefits provided by the government, a benefit not extended to individual citizens, meaning they should be held to certain standards even if it means occasionally denying a business owner's personal preferences. This line of thought could be considered as having successfully rebutted the original poster's view if the latter finds the distinction between persons and corporations compelling enough to reconsider his/her stance. \n\nPrediction: It is unclear if this argument would substantially change the original poster's view since it fundamentally hinges on the OP agreeing with this differentiation between an individual and a corporate entity. Therefore, I predict 'negative'."

        "prompt": "Original Post(OP)'s title: CMV: There is no practical reason for any individual to vote in national elections\nOriginal Post(OP)'s text: By \"practical reason,\" I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election.  I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough \"nation,\" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  \n\nThis is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).\n\nIt would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!\nArgument: That paper examines a random voter in a random state in a random election, but you said there's no reason for *any individual* to vote. I'm saying that it might make sense for individuals in very specific situations to vote. If the election appears to be especially close in terms of electoral votes (take the 2000 election for example), and your particular state has been polling at near equal support (Florida or New Mexico), then the probability of your vote making a difference could exceed 1 in 70,000. Depending on a person's valuation of costs and potential benefits, this could very well be enough for them to vote.\n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view.

        "response": "Explanation: The argument challenges the OP's view by presenting a scenario where an individual's vote could potentially make a difference in a tight national election, even if the probability is low. It also points out that the OP's blanket statement that there is no practical reason for any individual to vote might not hold true in specific circumstances. However, the argument doesn't address the OP's main concern of a direct cause-effect relationship between an individual's vote and the election outcome.\n\nPrediction: Negative. Though the argument raised some points for consideration, it may not have fully addressed the OP's main concern, which might result in the view not being changed."

This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.\n\nI believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering. If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.\n\nEdit: don't downvote me because you disagree with me.

We don't have the means to exactly account for and correct every historical injustice, and prejudices continue to affect policies today which leads to an unequal distribution of just about everything.\n\nAsk yourself: is this the first time you've felt genuinely unjustly treated? Is it the tenth? If so, you're way above most other groups. We're working on improving as a society, but one of the biggest barriers to that improvement is people in the advantaged group doing everything possible to maintain the advantage. There are plenty of ways that happens without anyone overtly or even consciously discriminating or further disadvantaging other groups. \n\nAll it takes is for those in an advantaged position to 'conveniently' notice and oppose the few times they don't get their way, while 'conveniently' ignoring or doing nothing about the larger and mre common aspects of the unfair system from which they benefit.\n\nExplanation: Based on the context and the argument presented, explain why this argument could or could not be considered as having successfully changed the main view expressed by the OP.\n\nPrediction: After providing your explanation, predict whether the argument has successfully changed the OP's view.

The commenter also suggests that people in advantaged positions often choose to focus on instances where they are seemingly disadvantaged, instead of acknowledging the overall system that works largely in their favor. The argument could potentially make the OP reevaluate their perspective and consider the broader societal context. However, it doesn't directly address the OP's argument about the validity of evaluations based solely on academic merits, rather than racial background.\n\nPrediction: Negative."

But the purpose of a scientific category like \"life\" is to aid our understanding by allowing us to make valid generalizations about things. You could come up with any number of categories with any number of criteria -- \"oceans\" and \"ocelots\" are both in the category of things which start with the letter \"o\" in English. But this is not a useful scientific category because there is no theory underpinning the common characteristics of those things. \n\nThe definition of life isn't arbitrary--it allows for overarching theoretical descriptions of the common characteristics of living organisms. The major theory underpinning life is evolution and natural selection. We cannot use evolutionary theory to draw valid inferences about how the Earth works.
