When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I\\'ll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil \\'cause they think it\\'s normal to torture animals, I understand it\\'s a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.\\n\\nI also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn\\'t change things a bit.\\n\\nAs of today I\\'m making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, \\'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I\\'m sorry but I just can\\'t believe I\\'m doing anything significant.\\n\\nI\\'m 100% convinced on what I\\'ve done for a year now, and I\\'ll become as \"vegan\" as possible in the future (I hate this whole \"vegan\" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I\\'m NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it\\'ll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.\\n\\nI know that for every person like me (and I\\'m nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don\\'t give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there\\'s no chance any of this will change. Change my view.\\n\\nOn the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I\\'ve been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they\\'d be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...\\n\\nFor me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It\\'s depressing.\\n\\nI still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it\\'s a GOOD thing by all means. It\\'s a fantastic feeling, it\\'s healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven\\'t stopped believing in the lifestyle and I\\'ll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.\\n\\n**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn\\'t justify changing my mind since I couldn\\'t help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**\\n\\n&gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.\\n\\nI have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there\\'s something to look for behind the hard numbers.\\n\\n**Another great argument with links**\\n\\n&gt; In short, the reality is: It adds up.  \\n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)  \\n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  \\nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds.

However, the OP's main view revolves around the idea that persons with a history of financial mismanagement, particularly in the contexts of inflating personal wealth or accumulating unnecessary debt, should not be trusted with the financial management of an entire country. This argument, therefore, does not specifically address the main concerns of the OP about the possible irresponsible financial behavior of these individuals and the potential implications when this behavior is translated to economic policy and administration.\n",

This touched on OP's concern about derailment of Issue X, but is still centered around making comparison between two issues, which is what the OP is against.

In this case, one twin is largely independent, while the other is mainly parasitic. The argument helps to project the question of bodily autonomy in another perspective.

      "Explanation: The argument states that a satellite needs to be in a specified position to stay fixed over the earth, meaning there is a limited amount of space available for satellites. This reduces the amount of potential 'room' for satellites and thus increases the chance of collisions with space debris. This counters the OP's view that there's a lot of space available, thereby reducing the likelihood of collisions.

The argument further seeks to refute the invasiveness aspect by explaining that users are aware of the rules and can choose not to post if they feel uncomfortable.

The argument points out that the issues aren't with limiting free speech or monetization, but with how these were handled under Pao, implying a possibility of better resolution under Huffman.

It points out that, although the internet, in particular sites like Reddit, can reinforce such behaviors, they are not inherently linked to being a white man. It also highlights that safe spaces for white males have not significantly decreased; instead, the number of spaces promoting disrespectful behaviors towards other groups has decreased. Finally, the argument challenges the notion that censorship of harmful behaviors is an attack on white males. \n",

It explains how in certain areas, the cost of buying a new car doesn't differ much from that of a used car, and that some cars don't depreciate much over time. Furthermore, it presents the worry that used cars could have underlying problems which would mean long term costs further down the line.

It highlights the point of view of the Allied forces at that time and details the immediate factors and pressures that contributed to the decision. It outlines the alternative plans and their estimated death tolls which were expected to be higher than the result of atomic bombings. With reference to official documents and diplomatic negotiations, it effectively asserts the argument that the atomic bombings were seen as the lesser evil compared to the alternative scenarios and were intended to hasten the end of the war with least possible casualties. It even provides a direct reference to a leaflet dropped by the American forces urging Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities before the bombings, supporting the argument that it was not an indiscriminate attack on civilians. The comparison between the bombings and 9/11 is also countered by arguing that it was not a premeditated act of terror but a desperate measure in the face of an escalating war. \n",

However, it doesn't specifically address OP's concern about the potential for future legalization of polygamy and other non-standard marriage arrangements.

      "Explanation: The commenter provides an entirely pragmatic look at why we have intellectual property laws, arguing that it's not about the ethics or morality of theft at all. Instead, it's about encouraging creativity by giving creators monopoly over their property for a limited duration to make their creations economically viable. They present the copyright clause of the US constitution as evidence for why such laws were actually made. The argument certainly presents a different perspective than the one originally put forward by the OP and invites them to reconsider their position.\n",

      "Explanation: The argument presented highlights an aspect that the original poster may not have considered, namely the effect on spouses who have stopped working to care for children, and other dependent parties such as the children themselves. It also brought up important points regarding the division of joint finances, and the need to protect the interests of all parties involved in a divorce, particularly when one spouse may be abusive.

They pointed out the psychological aspect of prostitution and its potential harm, not just physical dangers. They also raised awareness regarding the age and origin of most sex workers, bringing the conversation to topics such as abuse and human trafficking. They also recommended a source for OP to consider.

By providing examples of inexpensive vegetarian protein sources and pointing out that many people around the world survive on these, the respondent essentially undermines the OP's main premise. Furthermore, the respondent also highlights that an ethical position (like vegetarianism for ethical reasons) considers more than just economic aspects, thus challenging the simplistic manner in which the OP has chosen to evaluate vegetarianism.\n",

      "The argument pushes back on the original poster's (OP) view that a \"gay gene\" should be eliminated from the gene pool, emphasizing that such a measure would encourage a culture of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. It suggests that the lamentable state of LGBTQ+ issues—including suicide rates and societal acceptance—is largely a cultural problem, rather than a genetic or biological one. The counter-argument makes the analogy of eliminating a bigotry gene, illustrating that such measures become a dangerous slippery slope. It insists that the solution lies not in altering our genetic makeup to suit societal norms, but rather in shifting societal norms to accept diversity. \n",

The argument also tackles the OP's comparison with Hispanic struggles by highlighting issues such as illegal immigration, larger family sizes and higher rates of teen pregnancy which affect their economic status. The discussion about Asian populations' perceived positive stereotypes and lesser degree of oppression could challenge the OP's view as well.

It acknowledges that some aspects of attractiveness do involve personal responsibility but also highlights that a substantial proportion of prescribed solutions demand financial resources, which are often beyond the control of the individual.

      "Explanation: The argument tries to challenge the OP's view by giving a breakdown of the importance of each regular season game in different sports. The user explains how each set of season games build up to an excitement for the fans for different reasons, which vary based on the performance of the team. For instance, the user describes how the categories teams fall into can produce different types of tension and thrill throughout the NHL season. There's also the crucial role regular games play in the NFL due to its short season, and how even seemingly unimportant games can have big implications for the overall season outcome. This argument attacks the premise of the OP's view that regular season games are boring, by providing examples of how they hold value and excitement for fans, and emphasizes that each game could have a significant impact on the direction of a team's season.\n",

      "Prediction: The articulated points might convince the OP to approach viewing regular season games differently.

It gives concrete examples, like the refinement of the gravity concept misalignment between Newton's and Einstein's theories. The argument also stresses that without assuming uniformity, science might not have a strong justification to search for unifying theories.

      "Explanation: The argument presents two key points against the excessive use of sub-genres. It suggests that some genres are not legitimate, hence creating confusion, and that the overuse of genres can discourage novices and dampen their enthusiasm for music exploration. It also suggests that too much of genre policing might lead to loss of potential listeners.

Given these points, they argue that it is not a person's \"fault\" if they are not conventionally attractive, as the OP suggests. The response offers real-world examples to counter the OP's theory: allergies to make-up, financial constraints, the time required to maintain appearances and the need to prioritize caring for others over one's own personal appearance. However, the OP's somewhat dismissive attitude towards these factors in their original post might influence how they accept or reject these counter-arguments.\n",

      "Explanation: The argument presented is a logical one, confronting the OP with a different perspective: that of the individuals who work tirelessly and choose to keep their money for themselves. Contrasting this with those who just earn enough to get by, the argument raises a valid point that if one is obligated to give away their earnings, those with lesser earnings should also be obligated to earn more to meet these demands, keeping the equation balanced. This engages with the OP's belief that those with surplus income should donate it to charity. \n",

It proposes significant questions related to the subject matter that directly challenge the concept of an objective morality.

They argued that while everyone has the right to express their views, they must also face the repercussions, especially if their speech is disrespectful or harmful. The respondent went on to say that businesses, including online platforms, are under no obligation to endorse all types of speech. They highlighted that a company could dismiss an employee for making racist remarks, as this could harm the company's reputation.\n",

The OP believes that the BLM protesters' interruption of Sanders' rally was a strategic move as it would increase the spotlight on racial justice in his campaign, despite the initial backlash. Additionally, the OP compares Sanders' stance on racial justice with other political candidates and deems his policies weaker, and so, the interruption could spur more action in this area. However, the counter-argument suggests that the BLM movement should have targeted a candidate with a less supportive position, as it could potentially draw more attention to their cause and exert pressure on the other candidates to respond, thereby swaying public opinion.

They note that there would likely be debates about the simulation's realism and the validity of the supposed consequences resulting from a candidate's decisions. This point brings to light that simulations for politicians differ greatly from those for astronauts or pilots because political situations have much more complex and subtle variables. As a result, the utility of such political crisis simulations could be questionable, contradicting the OP's belief that they would provide valuable insights about a candidate's potential performance as a President.\n",

The example of teens getting a car and therefore spending more money is given, suggesting that there are indeed cases where an undesirable outcome (increased spending) is intrinsically linked to a particular action or event (getting a car). However, the argument does not address OP's claim that \"people and societies in general are... reasonable enough to know... they should stop before they get to the logical conclusion\".

The argument asserts that those who are comfortable sharing their face will share, and those who are not comfortable are filtered out, and this does not make the rule invasive or sexist. The user also contends that the difference in the treatment of the sexes is a result of contextual behavior rather than an act of oppression.\n",

The responder delves into the concept of time and the idea of meaning, arguing that our perception of 'meaning' and 'time' is subjective and conditioned through our evolutionary experience. Argument suggests that everything we perceive, from sensations to concepts, is a human interpretation instead of an absolute truth. By this logic, the 'futility' the OP perceives is also arbitrary and not a definitive fact. The responder also considers the idea of actions having an effect, etching out our significance in the universe.

The commentator could have also provided more verified information and data to back up the claims.

The commenter brings up valid points about the drastic effects of potentially doubling taxes for the poorer population and how this can lead to societal issues such as lower educational achievement and increased crime rates.

This challenges the OP's habit of judging the need for a handicapped spot based solely on physical appearance. The commenter also notes that not all disabled people require special cars with buttons and wheelchair contraptions, further refuting the OP's narrow definition of what qualifies for handicapped parking.

It highlights some of the issues with cultural appropriation such as taking elements out of context and commodification, which is to treat something that cannot be owned as a product that can be bought and sold. Using this analogy of misappropriation by aliens and then pulling it back to the BDSM culture, it puts into perspective the potential harm and misunderstanding that can spread from such actions.

Additionally, the analogy used comparing conversations in a coffee shop to public posts on social media provides a different perspective to consider. People's reactions to a third party listening in on their conversation in real life are often similar to their reactions when someone brings up something they've publicly posted on social media.

The argument focuses on two aspects of romantic love - prioritization and interconnection - which the writer argues differ from platonic love and physical attraction. By providing clear explanations for both these terms and how they work in the neurology of love, the writer successfully introduces a new perspective on the issue that challenges the OP's original view.

The argument raised points regarding the limitations of historical accuracy, such as instances where specific facts remain unknown, or information may come to light after the film is made. The commenter also emphasizes the original intent of \"based on a true story\", arguing it's not a promise of historical precision, but rather a sign that the narrative didn't solely come out of the filmmakers' imagination. Furthermore, they move the blame from filmmakers to educators, arguing for a more critical approach to the information students receive.

The argument then provides examples of similar cases in cisgender individuals and explains that it is society's non-acceptance, not the individual's transgender identity, that causes distress. Also, the comparison between a transgender individual seeking medical intervention and a headache sufferer taking Tylenol helps to clarify the idea that seeking medical solutions to a personal discomfort does not make it a mental disorder.

It presents several alternatives that could incapacitate the Joker but fall short of killing him, such as causing him physical damage or seeking the help of allies to impose some form of restraint on him. This approach challenges not only the notion that Batman is morally obliged to take the Joker's life, but also OP's assumption that lethal methods are the only effective solutions.

The argument suggests that there will not be a push for legalization of polygamy because the term itself is too variable and not clearly defined.

The commenter also speaks about the lack of nutritional knowledge that some people might have, which can make it difficult for them to maintain a balanced plant-based diet.

The argument suggests that these individuals had an inherent sense of devotion and loyalty to the party, which they demonstrated by actively pursuing roles of power within it.

They argue that while it's legal and that the person has effectively given the right to view those posts, it could still feel unsettling or creepy when someone does so, particularly if they feel pressured to maintain a social media presence out of a fear that not doing so would make them seem strange or antisocial. The commenter also touches on the question of boundaries. However, this argument does not really address OP's belief about the presumption that people know what they are doing when they post online. The commenter's statement that they just add people they \"somewhat know\" to their social media contradicts OP's assertion that people are fully aware of what they're doing online and posting accordingly. \n",

While it presents solid points from an economic perspective, it does not directly address the OP's argument about political priorities or the cyclical nature of economies.

The argument explains that since businesses, especially conglomerates, enjoy benefits such as protection from personal liability and diverse tax schemes, it's reasonable for the government to place certain conditions on them, like preventing discrimination against customer groups.

However, the commenter doesn't directly challenge the OP's view that obesity still functions as a disability in the sense that it impacts a person's ability to perform normal daily tasks.

Further, the argument challenges OP's economic claims by referring to the concept of a stimulus check, presenting an alternate perspective on how GDP could be impacted. Additionally, it poses a question about the arbitrary line between 'mild' and 'severe' chronic illness, providing an analogy with the elderly to highlight the potential unfairness of the OP's proposition.\n",

The user also emphasizes that human life should not be traded unless under very specific circumstances. \n",

From the original post, it appears that the OP takes a utilitarian stance, emphasizing that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

The argument refutes the OP's point about resources wasted on pandas, insinuating these efforts serve a broader purpose than just saving pandas themselves. It reinforces this with a hypothetical question probing whether the OP would be willing to abandon protection for all 'flagship species’ as well.

The commenter suggested that the OP consider the personality and character of a potential partner before engaging in sexual activity, and then progress slowly in sexual activity to ensure mutual understanding and consent. This proposed approach doesn't outright dismiss the OP's fear but recontextualizes it in a broader perspective of careful personal relationships and communication.\n",

The commenter discusses how the appeal in the genre could be emotional, rather than aural distinction between songs, I can see this comparison possibly making the OP think of the genres from a different perspective.

The point made is that not all students have the same ambitions or capabilities, so a \"one size fits all\" approach does not cater for these students.

The counter-argument is that individual Vulcans might be superior in certain ways but not necessarily in others - indicating a more nuanced perspective. This suggests that they believe there isn't a clear-cut superiority of one race over the other, and it depends on various factors and the roles they are assigned.

The counter-argument, while it brings up valid points about the intrinsic value of education and the need for mechanisms to distinguish high-achieving students, does not necessarily demonstrate that a free education system wouldn't diminish the value of a degree.

The argument suggests that the OP's suggestion of starting unsolicited conversations with strangers is not only socially inappropriate but also unlikely to lead to any meaningful connection or empathy. The response also offers a different perspective, suggesting that digital connectedness is actually more conducive to striking up conversations with \"true strangers\" from diverse backgrounds, thus introducing the individual to a wider range of viewpoints and experiences than they could encounter in their geographic neighborhood. Overall, the response provides a well-reasoned counterargument to the OP's view.\n",

The argument clarified that public transportation and personal vehicles aren't necessarily alternatives to each other but can coexist in serving the transportation needs of the public, further highlighting that both have their own advantages and disadvantages.

It touches upon the issues of legality, stigmatization of race, cultural disparities, and economic hardships that shape the lived experiences of these groups in different ways. Although the argument does not directly refute the OP's premise relating to the success of Asian immigrants, it indirectly emphasizes the distinctive hurdles faced by Black and Hispanic communities.

This part of the argument could challenge the OP's view by making them consider complexities of implementing a socialist system they might not have considered before.

This way, investors would only collect a share of the student's earnings that exceed the amount they would typically earn without a degree, providing a sort of safety net for the student.

They also counter the OP's argument on the effectiveness of Gotham's police force by stating that they have been largely corrupted or have given up due to the intensity of the city's crime. However, the key point of disagreement on the Batman's approach might still remain for the OP, which might prevent the argument from successfully changing the OP's view.\n",

      "The argument tackles the potential issues of government overreach by pointing out other areas of life where the government might intervene with the same logic, which was invoked by the OP to defend prosecuting parents of obese children. The arguer's point regarding the responsibilities of the children themselves, particularly as they grow older, also counters the premise that parents are solely to blame. Furthermore, the argument also questions the consequences of prosecution on families and whether it genuinely benefits the children's well-being. However, it does not specifically address the OP's main point about the need to combat obesity through punitive measures. It only suggests education as an alternative, without expounding on how this might be more effective.\n",

      "Explanation: The commenter countered each of the OP's original points presenting counter arguments and offering examples against the \"Kurdish good guys\" narrative that the OP had. The argument illustrates the many complexities of the Middle East, the diverse interests present, and argues that each actor is primarily self-interested and this has led to unlikely alliances based not on shared values or morals, but on shared interests and preserving one's own survival. This takes away from the simplicity and positivity of the idea of the Kurds as heroes, but it is not conclusively negative about them either. \n",

It challenges the original post by presenting the drawbacks and limitations of the Vulcan society such as their difficulty in dealing with conflicts due to their logical and emotional suppression, the negative impact of their supposed 'superiority' on their interactions with other races, and their struggle with arrogance. It cites examples from the Star Trek series to support these points. It effectively reframes the idea of human 'greed' and 'ambition' as positive attributes that have led to the betterment of humanity and their distinctive standing in the federation.

It argues against commonly targeted programs for cuts, explaining why reducing funding may not be beneficial in the long term. It also offers a different perspective on government debt, explaining that not only can it be managed effectively, but getting rid of it entirely could cause other issues.

It further explains the benefits of Spotify's accessibility on any computer, and its advantage of having easy access to new songs without needing to purchase them individually. Since cost and ease of access could be important factors for the OP, these arguments might speak to them.

It points out the unfairness of invalidating someone's distress, and suggests that accomodating to a person's \"triggers\" is not much of an inconvenience to others and shouldn't be an issue. This argument considers the individuality of human responses to emotional distress, and acknowledges the existence of \"real\" triggers, taking a contrasting position to that of the author's. \n",

It challenges the OP's assumption that the economy only includes goods and not services, and then expands on the complexity of people's spending habits and how they contribute to economic growth. The argument also refutes OP's claim that politicians are not prioritizing education or healthcare, which are significant components of a country's economy.

On the first point, it explains that the fleeting existence of certain elements is not a reason for their exclusion from the periodic table as all elements possess a finite lifespan. As for the second point, the argument reasons that it is premature to assume that these synthetically created elements don't exist in nature since not all of the universe has been observed.

It highlights that voting for a representative doesn't give them absolute power or require them to be an expert in every field, but allows them to focus on areas where they are knowledgeable.

The argument also states the fact that children often have a limited understanding of the adult's decision process, and there may be reasons why an adult says 'because I said so'.

The argument also diverts from the OP's main point by focusing primarily on political discrimination in general rather than specifically on the necessity of affirmative action for conservatives at universities. It does present valid concerns about suppressing conservative viewpoints but doesn't convincingly argue against the implementation of the measure proposed by the OP--using affirmative action to increase conservative representation--as it does not touch on the potential negative consequences of such action, and none of its points directly contradict the OP's viewpoint.\n",

This view challenges the original post's definition of 'alive' as involving regular, predictable patterns and movements, changes, and so on. The counter-argument suggests that the Earth is mostly inorganic matter - rocks, iron, etc. - and therefore cannot fall under the definition of a 'living' or 'alive' organism.

The second point addressed is the potential irreversible damage caused by wrongful convictions if the option to end ones life is available to them.

      "Explanation: The argument presented brings up a few points that underscore potential negative impacts of the BLM interruption at the Sanders' rally. These points namely revolve around Sanders' ability to expand his base beyond his current supporters, his perceived capacity to hold his own when faced with opposition, and the potential of losing publicity to more prominent candidates. These arguments essentially challenge the OP's view that the interruption would result in minimal backlash or negative consequences for the BLM movement and Sanders' campaign, suggesting instead that it could detrimentally impact his image and his chance at winning the nomination.\n",

      "Explanation: The commenter here does not make a strong argument for the safety or effectiveness of vaccines, which is the main concern for the original poster.

      "Explanation: The argument presented offers two reasons as to why prescription drug advertisements are allowed. The first point, being free speech, emphasizes the restrictions placed on the government's ability to suppress the voicing of true statements, while also mentioning the additional restrictions placed on commercial speech, which these advertisements would fall under. The second point highlights the benefits these advertisements can provide to individuals suffering from low-level chronic conditions who may be unaware that these options exist. Although the presented argument offers a logical and clear explanation, it doesn't directly address the OP's concerns about the potential for these ads to create a demand for drugs that may not be needed, or put unnecessary pressure on doctors.\n",

It brings up the fact that there are strong incentives, both personal and legal, for new residents to gain at least some proficiency in the local dialect. \n",
      "However, there's little concrete evidence presented to totally counteract the OP's standpoint. The argument does not completely address the concern of the OP about immigrants not wanting to learn the language and causing racial or cultural tension.

      "Explanation: This argument approaches the OP's view from a couple of different angles. First, it addresses the potential for an oppressive cycle where only the educated and presumably well-off citizens would have voting rights, leading to a possible maintenance of their own status at the expense of others. Second, it points out that elected officials themselves often lack specific expertise in the areas they oversee, which could be construed as contradicting the OP's request for only knowledgeable people to make decisions. While this does address the OP's concerns, it does not necessarily overturn the core of their view, as it might even provide additional support for their claim that more knowledge should be required to make decisions. It's also relevant to note that the OP has already mentioned that their view was modified by another user.\n",

They talk about economic and social reasons of learning European languages for someone living in Europe. They also point about the practical advantages of learning  European languages, which includes immersion. It does not negate the OP's point about the cultural, media and travel advantages of learning East Asian languages, but rather gives different aspects about the benefits of European languages.\n",

      "Explanation: The argument introduced the perspective that life's quality, whether good or bad, is dependent on one's actions or the lack thereof. Additionally, it mentions that the feelings we attribute to life are essentially based on the chemicals in our brains and nerves. This brings the angle of personal responsibility and the subjective interpretation of life's experiences into the discussion, rather than positioning life as intrinsically negative or positive.

It acknowledges that morality is a prevalent theme within literature, but also emphasizes other essential aspects of the human experience that are commonly explored within literature, like consciousness and empathy. The argument essentially asserts that literature's purpose is more comprehensive and multi-dimensional than solely defining morality, and thus challenges the original post's view. \n",

It pointed out that Hulu initially lacked ads, and that they have continued to add more over time, making it feel like the service is overstuffed with ads. The commenter also mentioned that even when paying for Hulu Plus, some shows are reserved as \"Web only\" or require a subscription to a cable/satellite provider, decreasing the value as well.

The argument also posits that in the long run, the standards of living will be equitable, addressing the OP's concern about wealth accumulation in developed countries.\n",
      "Prediction: However, the argument does not directly address the claim about developing countries being stuck in lower-income lifestyles due to the wealth accumulation in developed countries, so the impact on the OP's view would most likely be inconclusive or incomplete.

      "Explanation: The argument presents a perspective that technology, though beneficial, can also amplify negative human traits and end up causing harm. By giving the example of fission technology bringing both goods and evils, it is highlighting how the very technology that can be used for power generation can also be used to create deadly weapons. This counterargument does address the OP's claim that new technologies are completely beneficial and can't be used with evil intentions, demonstrating a flaw in the OP's reasoning.\n",
      "\n",

The commentator appeals to the OP's understanding of personal growth, referencing how much individuals change over the span of a decade.

The commenter also does a good job of explaining why this misconception might be prevalent due to the overexposure of such stories on the internet. \n",

The statement seems to be an analogy that is not thoroughly explained, thus, failing to clarify why being pro-life could be equated with forcing one's views on others.

It also addresses the claim that guns take more lives than they save, arguing that true statistics are hard to come by and that removing guns from the equation doesn't necessarily reduce overall crime rates. However, while this argument does logically present the case for firearm ownership as tied to self-defense, it doesn't necessarily address OP's request for a clear logical derivation from nature for the right to bear arms.

This analogy assumes that by choosing to cross the street, one is automatically accepting the risk of being hit by a vehicle. Similarly, by choosing a pro-life stance, OP is accepting the risk of harming another person's life or wellbeing should they not have access to a safe and legal abortion.

The commenter suggests that while animals may not be capable of giving their consent to be owned as pets or used for food, engaging in sexual activity with an animal is a unique situation that animals are incapable of consenting to, similar to the way children can't consent to sex. The comparison between how society treats animals and children provides a new perspective on the issue.

It advises against direct confrontation with the police not because it condones actions of the police that may overstep their authority, but since it may be more beneficial or even safer for the individual to fight in a legal battleground rather than face-to-face. While this argument isn't directly in line with the OP's view that the police's authority must always be challenged, it does provide another avenue for this challenge to happen in a court of law.

The argument also highlights the requirement of experience and skill to develop a flow in rapping, offering a different perspective to the OP's views about rapping. This could potentially make the OP reassess his stance about the skill set required for rapping.

The speaker proposes an alternative focus to the existential crisis the original poster is experiencing, suggesting that acknowledging our existence's significant improbability and appreciating the brief window of consciousness we are given can bring about a sense of purpose. The argument also encourages embracing human nature and fulfilling our innate tendencies to create connections and help others as paths to happiness and meaning. The argument not only counters the general sentiments of the original post of life being meaningless and full of suffering but also proposes different ways to approach and appreciate life.

They also suggest that if the OP doesn't like the country music that does break this mold, it's possibly a matter of personal taste.

Additionally, the argument may deviate from the OP's view due to its focus on the uniformity of nature's laws, not scientists's approach to its study.

The commenter strongly refutes the idea that asexuality is a trend and outlines how this orientation creates significant challenges in their relationships and personal life. They illustrate how asexuality is not something a person chooses, and not just a stage or a phase of experimentation, but something that persists throughout their life. By sharing this, it provides a stark contrast to the OP's depiction of asexuality as simply a trend or a manner of seeking attention. These new perspectives could change the OP's view by showing them that being asexual is not a ploy for attention, but rather a legitimate sexual orientation that people struggle with due to societal expectations around sex.

The argument also provides a hypothetical scenario to explain the chaos that could ensue if the government didn't provide that protection, asserting that even deceased individuals need their assets to be guarded.

The comment also introduces an alternative perspective where the party leaders' long-term affiliation and dedication to their party might motivate them to prioritize their party's interests over their personal aspirations for leadership.

This suggests it's not inherently about disliking pineapple on pizza or believing there's something wrong with those who enjoy it, but rather about the specific preparation and execution of that concept. It appeals to the authority of a renowned food critic, which gives weight to the viewpoint that not all pineapple pizzas need to be 'vile' as the OP mentioned.

The results of their actions (for example, tax cuts versus bailouts) would not emerge until much later, and the simulation might not be equipped to predict these outcomes.

The arguer suggests that the methodological approach of discrete mathematics incorporates statistics as a main concept while covering other principles like set theory, deductive reasoning, combinatorics, and probability, while traditional math courses usually lack this comprehensive approach. However, the arguer's suggestion is predicated on an acceptance of current mathematics teaching as less than ideal and an assumption that statistics should be included as a part of the curriculum.

It introduces examples of how an economy may be providing for those groups of people who are not contributing to it, and shows how valuing life can be a reasonable enough incentive even in the face of economic drawbacks. Yet, while the argument does a good job of challenging OP's premise and drawing attention to the ethical considerations that may motivate vegetarians, it does not directly engage with OP's main assertion that such choices are against humans.

The commenter claims that it all comes down to management, but doesn't provide any alternative solutions to the corruption and financial disasters that the OP mentioned. In addition, suggesting that cities will become \"wiser about not overspending\" seems rather naive and doesn't address the underlying issues.\n",

It also proposes that a crisis simulation may not realistically depict the real-world results of policy implementation. However, it does not directly counter the OP's main view that crisis simulations would provide valuable insights into how candidates assess situations, handle disagreement, and demonstrate their understanding of governmental operations.

The OP claimed they were happy about the banning of a specific subreddit due to its hateful nature and harmful impact on certain users, including themselves. While the argument offers Reddit's historical stance on free speech and suggests some hypocrisy in the recent banning of certain subreddits, it does not engage with the substantive difference the OP sees between hate speech (like in Coontown) and other controversial subreddits, nor challenge the OP's belief in the merits of removing such content from the platform.\n",

However, the OP's point was that those who have no interest in educating themselves about politics should not be encouraged to vote. The argument didn't really address that point, and only proposed an ideal scenario where the voters are eager to learn before voting. Therefore, it is unlikely to have changed the OP's view.\n",

However, the OP's core concern was about the financial stability and safety of such a career, not whether it requires skill or hard work. The counter-argument doesn't provide a strong case for financial stability or safety in online entertainment, even for those who are dedicated and skilled. It also, in fact, seemed to agree with the OP's view that \"making money (enough to sustain yourself) only happens to a few.\" The argument doesn't present a strong case for why pursuing online entertainment could be considered a reliable source of livelihood.

The argument does provide further context to OP's understanding by noting the political nature of the feminist movement, but it doesn't necessarily address their concerns within that context.

From an ecological standpoint, the responder did a fine job explaining the natural, cyclical trend of population growth and decline.
